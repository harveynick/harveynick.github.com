  <h2><a href="/blog/2014/04/27/is-it-that-time-again/">Is It Time to Change Blogs Again?</a></h2>
  
  <p>
    <p>So you may have noticed that it&rsquo;s been a little quiet around here as of late. There are a few reasons for this. Firstly, I&rsquo;ve been stupidly busy with work and the amount of&hellip; faff involved with adding a new post using <a href="http://octopress.org">Octopress</a> has been something of a blocker.</p>




<p>You see, Octopress Isn&rsquo;t like Wordpress or Blogger. It doesn&rsquo;t run on a server out there in the cloud. It&rsquo;s a program and a set of files on your local machine. You create new posts as text files, then run the program. This generates a set of HTML files, which you then upload to a server. In some ways this is a lot closer to programming than regular writing.</p>




<p>So when I upgraded my computer it was more than a small amount of effort to reassemble all of the different components required for this. It took me a while to work up the enthusiasm. Plus: not everything worked. Hence the fact that I&rsquo;m back on the default theme.</p>




<p>So, I got to thinking&hellip; perhaps it&rsquo;s time to look at other options. Again.</p>

  <h2><a href="/blog/2013/09/14/am-i-winning/">Some Thoughts on Gamification</a></h2>
  
  <p>
    <p>If you&rsquo;re playing any sort of a game, the question &ldquo;Am I winning?&rdquo; is usually quite easy to answer. &ldquo;Is my score higher than the other guy?&rdquo; usually covers it (though if you&rsquo;re playing something like chess it might be a little more complicated than that). If you&rsquo;re playing a computer game the fact that your character is still alive may well be enough to settle this question in your favour.</p>




<p>In life, though, it is a much harder question to answer. It may well be true that, to the healthy mind, it&rsquo;s not something which should ever really matter, but <a href="http://harveynick.com/blog/2013/05/06/do-you-even-lift/">as noted before</a>, gamification works really (embarrassingly) well for me.</p>




<p>I suspect that deep down most people have their own ways of keeping score. Their bank balance. Their air miles account. How far they ran today. More abstract things, such as their perceived quality of the of the photos they took this weekend, leaning to less abstract things, actual scores, such as might be gleaned from <a href="https://www.fitocracy.com/">Fitocracy</a> or <a href="https://foursquare.com">Foursquare</a>.</p>

  <h2><a href="/blog/2013/08/11/whilst-not-running-in-australia/">Whilst Not Running in Australia (With Photos!)</a></h2>
  
  <p>
    <p>In throwing up a few pictures of my trip down under in that <a href="blog/2013/04/07/running-the-first-time/">previous running related post</a>, I realised I hadn&rsquo;t really posted much else about that particular trip to the inter webs. I also realised that picking through those photos is a bit of a bad idea, because I&rsquo;d forgotten just how much I enjoyed Perth.</p>




<p>I tend to say that I &ldquo;spent about 10 weeks in Australia in 2010.&rdquo; I use this slightly odd wording because I actually had two trips out there with a short break in-between. That break was partly due to logistics and also because the customer decided to finally announce they wanted me on site a little under six weeks before the single date for the entire of 2010 for which I refused to be anywhere other than St Andrews, Scotland. This was the date of a good friend&rsquo;s wedding, at which I was to be a groomsman (among the biggest honours which has ever by extended to me) and thus it was not even on the negotiating table. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry,&rdquo; they said. &ldquo;Our operations calendar is such that we won&rsquo;t need you for more than a couple of weeks.&rdquo; I&rsquo;m sure you can see where this is going…</p>

  <h2><a href="/blog/2013/08/10/so-i-made-an-iphone-app/">So I Made an iPhone App</a></h2>
  
  <p>
    <p>Various things have kept me busy and away from this blog just recently. I&rsquo;ve done a bit of traveling (both for business and pleasure), I&rsquo;ve discovered Netflix (and Crunchyroll), and, somewhat more productively, I followed through on what started off as my &ldquo;20% time&rdquo; project.</p>




<p>There is, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id680739529?mt=8">right now in the iPhone App Store</a>, an app nominally <em>by Google Inc</em> which was written almost entirely by my own good hands. Obviously I wasn&rsquo;t entirely a one man band in this. I had a lot of help from designers and UX people, my code was reviewed by those who were available to do so, and I had support at the product management level. I also had a very understanding manager who was willing to let me devote an increasing amount of my time to this.</p>

  <h2><a href="/blog/2013/06/16/that-ad/">That Ad</a></h2>
  
  <p>
    <p>So. There has been a small(ish) ad off to the right hand side of this blog for a couple of months now. It is as small as <a href="https://www.google.com/adsense">AdSense</a> will let me make it, though ideally I&rsquo;d prefer if it had a size not unlike those used by <a href="http://mattgemmell.com/">Matt Gemmell</a> and
<a href="http://www.marco.org/">Marco Arment</a>. On the whole, though, it doesn&rsquo;t bother me as much as I worried it might, aside from the occasional animated flash ad.</p>

  <p>
    <p>So: after writing that giant post about the three main beginners programs I read up on while trying to figure out the best way to get myself into some sort of (non round) shape, I thought I&rsquo;d switch to a topic on which I can confidently talk with some authority: me.</p>




<p>More specifically, in case you are interested: the program I&rsquo;ve ended up putting myself on, the other things which are important and how this all is actually working out for me.</p>

    <p>As I promised in my <a href="blog/2013/05/06/do-you-even-lift/">last post</a>, I&rsquo;d now like to talk a bit about the different weight lifting programs I ended up researching. I spent a fairly silly amount of time here, so I&rsquo;m hoping that you find it useful.</p>




<p>I&rsquo;m going to talk about the three primary beginners lifters programs I read up on, tell you what they actually involve… and also what I think the person behind them is trying to sell you.</p>

  <h2><a href="/blog/2013/05/06/do-you-even-lift/">Do You Even Lift, Bro?</a></h2>
  
  <p>
    <p>After I arrived in London I decided to take a second stab at Couch to 5k, having abandoned it <a href="blog/2013/04/07/running-the-first-time/">the first time around</a>. The problem now was finding a time and place. At first I tried running in the evenings around Wandsworth Common, conveniently close to where I was staying. That started to feel more than a little unsafe, however, especially on the evenings I got home safe enough to push me through -twilight- dusk and into full dark. I&rsquo;m fortunate enough to work very close to Hyde Park, however, so I transplanted my runs here and started taking time out of my work day. Running through Hyde Park in the sun is awesome, by the way.</p>




<p>All was fine and dandy until I fell off a surf board during a short break and cracked the top of my foot against the sea bed. I&rsquo;d twisted myself into a slightly odd position in order to accomplishing this, and so it had the added bonus effect of pushing my foot much further back than it&rsquo;s really supposed to go. By the time I got back to London, my entire foot had turned a lovely combination of purple and yellow. Shit.</p>

  <p>
    <p>On what was, all things considered, otherwise a fairly shitty day, I finished reading A Memory of Light, the final volume of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wheel_of_Time">The Wheel of Time</a>. This is, if you don&rsquo;t know, a fourteen book epic fantasy series whose author died prior to its completion. Each of these books is, by itself, around the size of the entire Lord of the Rings trilogy. One or two of them are really very dry, and finishing them comes dangerously close to feeling like work.</p>




<p>So do I recommend that you set out on this 12 thousand page, 4 million word journey? Emphatically yes.</p>

  <p>
    <p>A friend told me about a restaurant he&rsquo;d visited on a trip to New York. There was essentially no menu. You walked in, you are seated, and you are asked a single question:</p>




<blockquote><p>&#8220;How would you like your steak cooked?&#8221;</p></blockquote>




<p>Then they bring you an utterly fantastic steak with fries and bernaise sauce. They do this <em>one</em> thing, they do it incredibly well, and they do it cheaply because they can take advantage of economies of scale.</p>




<p>I love this mindset of setting out to do something as utterly right as humanly possible. The example I had previously was a cafe in Edinburgh called Loudon&rsquo;s. This is obviously the result of someone setting out to create as perfect a cafe as possible. It&rsquo;s incredibly well laid out. Lots of tables, but not even a little bit cramped. So much so, in fact, that the presence of parents with small children doesn&rsquo;t ruin the atmosphere. They just get lost in the space. This is not enough by itself, obviously. The coffee is also very good and the food is absolutely first rate. Don&rsquo;t even get me started on either the quantity or the quality of the cakes.</p>




<p>So where am I going with this? Well, this last week during a short(ish) break in Austria, I found another one.</p>

  <h2><a href="/blog/2013/04/07/running-the-first-time/">Running, the First Time</a></h2>
  
  <p>
    <p>When I decided to drag myself back on to the fitness wagon, it seemed to me that running was the answer. Getting myself to an actual gym clearly wasn&rsquo;t working, but I lived a short walk from a large and beautiful park (oh The Meadows, how I miss you still). I went out and spent what I still consider to be a fair amount of money on a pair of running shoes (Nike+ compatible, obviously). I&rsquo;ve had knee issues in the past, which motivated me to err towards the top end of the range, I swear. The presence of the striking red headed shop assistant with her beautiful blue eyes and athletic physique had absolutely nothing to do with my decision.</p>

  <h2><a href="/blog/2013/04/01/a-fitness-story/">A Fitness Story</a></h2>
  
  <p>
    <p>During most of university I was in pretty crap shape, but in the second year of my PhD my physical condition got particularly lousy. I caught a bus every morning which left from directly outside my flat and took me directly to the university. I did pretty much no exercise and ate an awful lot of takeaway. A few of my friends remarked that I&rsquo;d gained weight. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry,&rdquo; they said &ldquo;it&rsquo;s fine,&rdquo; in response to my mortified expression, I&rsquo;m sure &ldquo;You look well with it&rdquo;. But I knew I looked nothing of the sort.  To paraphrase Eddie Izzard: when I looked in the mirror I sure as hell didn&rsquo;t want to have sex with myself.</p>

  <h2><a href="/blog/2013/03/25/categories-and-goals/">Categories and Goals</a></h2>
  
  <p>
    <p>It&rsquo;s good to have goals. Even if you fail to meet them. Sometimes especially when you fail to meet them. It&rsquo;s quite widely publicized that at Google we&rsquo;re expected to score 0.7 (on a scale where 0 is a complete failure and 1 means all targets were met) when assessing our OKRs (objectives and key results). Generally this is good. It means you&rsquo;re always striving, always raising your eyes, hitting the top of the tree by aiming for the sky.</p>




<p>In my personal life, though, this probably isn&rsquo;t the best approach. Be that as it may, this year I have goals.</p>

  <h2><a href="/blog/2013/03/22/ch-ch-ch-changes/">Ch-Ch-Ch-Changes</a></h2>
  
  <p>
    <p>So a couple of things about this website have changed. Perhaps you&rsquo;ve noticed.</p>




<p>Firstly, I changed the background. Much as I love that dark linen image I was using, it&rsquo;s really obviously &ldquo;the apple background&rdquo;, which carries connotations I didn&rsquo;t really want to project. The first place I saw it was on an apple device, granted, but I wasn&rsquo;t using it <em>because</em> it&rsquo;s the apple background. The new one is similar aesthetically, yet distinct enough that I don&rsquo;t think it screams &ldquo;fanboi&rdquo;. It&rsquo;ll do for now. More on that later.</p>




<p>I&rsquo;ve also removed that cool effect where the background and title remained static, and the actual content appear to slide up an over them. Again, I loved it, but it made the scrolling really janky on a lot of devices. I&rsquo;m choosing to assume it was the combination of the drop shadow and static background which was causing this&hellip; and since the slide effect doesn&rsquo;t work anywhere near as well without the drop shadow, but the drop shadow seems just fine without the slide I&rsquo;ve decided to move over to plain old normal scrolling. Unless you&rsquo;re on a really small screen, in which case the drop shadow should disappear as well (try resizing your browser window, you&rsquo;ll see what I mean).</p>

    <p>While <a href="http://badassdigest.com/2013/01/09/film-crit-hulk-smash-hulk-vs.-tom-hooper-and-art-of-cinematic-affectation/">Film Critic Hulk&rsquo;s argument</a> generally seems quite well reasoned, I find it a little difficult to stomach someone attempting to lecture me on the theory behind the form of anything in ALL CAPS, and at such length. Also, he makes the unforgivable (in my opinion) mistake of representing his opinion as fact. He states the film falls flat, not that he <strong>believes</strong> it falls flat. No one, apparently, thought to mention this to the legions of people who rated Les Mis so highly on IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes.</p>

  <h2><a href="/blog/2012/05/17/wandering-around-london/">Wandering Around London</a></h2>
  
  <p>
    <p>Apologies, once again, for the radio silence. Over the past couple of months there have been some complications in my private life, and a remarkable amount of my attention has been taken up with figuring out where exactly I&rsquo;m going to be living after my current lease runs out (more on that later, perhaps).</p>




<p>Be that as it may, after almost a year, I did find some time to go wandering around the city I now call home. Whilst I took every opportunity to make a brisk constitutional around Edinburgh, I&rsquo;d never managed to really do this in London. Part of the reason, I think, is while that you can essentially wander across central Edinburgh in an hour or two, this is really not the case in London. Nipping across town via public transport can take <em>hours</em>.</p>




<p>Recently, though, two excellent excuses presented themselves. Firstly, my father came to visit for a few days and professed an interest to go take a good look at <a href="http://www.kew.org/">Kew Gardens</a>, the Japanese themed portion in particular.</p>

  <p>
    <p><em>Fair warning: this is going to be a bit of a programming heavy blog post. It&rsquo;s also going to be quite Mac specific.</em></p>




<p>One of the things I wanted to change about the format of this blog was to make it more visual, specifically with pictures. This first part of this was to add pictures to the front page. There were a couple of options for doing so. I could just scan through an article, look for the first image tag and use this. Alternatively I could add a mechanism which allowed me to choose the image, in a similar manner to the way <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a> allows me to choose the except which appears on the front page. I decided to go with option two.</p>

  <h2><a href="/blog/2012/03/27/origin/">Origin Story, Raspberry Pi, and the ZX Spectrum</a></h2>
  
  <p>
    <p>One of the fun things about working for Google is that from time to time interesting people come into the office to give talks. We had Richard Dawkins a few weeks ago, who gave an interesting if… uncompromising talk. Yesterday we had one of the founders of the <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a> foundation. For those of you who aren&rsquo;t aware, the Raspberry Pi is an extremely small (exactly credit card sized) and cheap ($25), yet very capable computing platform. The foundation is the charity formed to produce this hardware.</p>




<p>Why is a charity building computer hardware? Because there is a need for it, caused by a problem you&rsquo;re possibly not even aware of. Let me explain; for I am part of the problem. These days when I play computer games it&rsquo;s usually on my X-Box or iPhone. They make my life very easy in this regard, since I never have to worry about whether a game will actually run or not. It just works. They are essentially closed systems, though. There is a reasonably high barrier to entry if I actually want to start playing with them as a developer. Specifically: I can&rsquo;t do it on the device itself. Furthermore, the very simplicity of the device works against me in this regard, because very little action on my part is required to make it work.</p>




<p>It was not always this way. Let me tell you a story.</p>

  <h2><a href="/blog/2012/03/17/new-ish-year-new-ish-blog/">New (Ish) Year, New (Ish) Blog</a></h2>
  
  <p>
    <p>2011 was an interesting year for me. A lot changed. I turned 30. After 10 years of residency I moved away from Edinburgh, a city I love dearly, and took a job in London. With <a href="/blog/tags/google">Google</a>. As a result, I no longer work with <a href="/blog/tags/autonomous-underwater-vehicles">Autonomous Underwater Vehicles</a> for a living. Instead I build web services. Quite the change, I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll agree. In the early months of the year I finally completed the corrections to my <a href="/blog/tags/phd">PhD</a>, and then in the summer: I graduated. It took 6 years (all together) but I am now Dr. Nick Johnson. I also <a href="/blog/2011/07/18/the-sound-of-one-hand-clapping/">lost my grandmother</a>, a fact which still brings me to tears on occasion.</p>




<p>In this light, the fact that I decided, towards the end of the year, to shift my blog away from <a href="http://wordpress.org">Wordpress</a> and over to its own domain barely even casts a shadow. I did, though, and as a result you&rsquo;re now reading these words on a site built using <a href="http://octopress.org">Octopress</a>, which is hosted at harveynick.com. As you may have noticed, all of the old posts from my <a href="http://harveynick.wordpress.com">wordpress site</a> have been ported over, minus the short film reviews, which you&rsquo;ll find <a href="http://ohsohumbleopinion.tumblr.com">here</a>. I&rsquo;m not going to go into how I accomplished this, except to say: I did it the same way <a href="http://mattgemmell.com/2011/09/12/blogging-with-octopress/">Matt Gemmel did</a>.</p>

  <p>
    <p>At the end of the <a href="/blog/2010/10/22/now-in-eye-popping-3d/">last post</a> I wrote about the actual implementation of my Clockwork Aphid project, I said the next step was going to be display simplification. At that point I&rsquo;d generated a few landscapes which were just starting barely starting to test the limits of my computer, though they were nothing like the size or complexity I had in mind. That said, it was looking at landscapes containing 1579008 polygons and it was obvious that not all of these needed to be put on screen. Moreover, because my landscapes are essentially made up of discrete samples (or nodes): I needed to reduce the number of samples which were displayed to the user, otherwise my performance was really going to tank as the landscapes increased in size.</p>

  <p>
    <p>Monday the 5th of September was Freddie Mercury day. The day he would have turned 65, had he lived. This makes me feel a little old, but that&rsquo;s not the point. The day&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX2BQM0D01M">Google doodle</a> (pointed out to me with furious glee by one of my coworkers) led me to YouTube and numerous videos of Queen performing live. As I often do, I&rsquo;d forgotten just how good they were. I spent much of the day fighting the urge to pump my fist and throw shapes at my desk*. Since I had so much fun with this, I&rsquo;m going to pepper this post with some of the videos I found the most fun. Anything under the videos and written in italics is a comment on the video itself, and not strictly related to the rest of this post.</p>

  <h2><a href="/blog/2011/09/14/revisiting-the-language-issue/">Revisiting the Language Issue</a></h2>
  
  <p>
    <p>Some time ago, I wrote a <a href="/blog/2010/10/09/youre-speaking-my-language-baby-part-1-introduction/">series</a> <a href="/blog/2010/10/10/youre-speaking-my-language-baby-part-2-java/">of</a> <a href="/blog/2010/10/11/youre-speaking-my-language-baby-part-3-c/">posts</a> <a href="/blog/2010/10/12/youre-speaking-my-language-baby-part-4-objective-c/">about</a> <a href="/blog/2010/10/13/youre-speaking-my-language-baby-part-5-conclusion/">language</a> choice for my Clockwork Aphid project. In the end I decided to start the project in Java, this being the language I&rsquo;m most comfortable with. Once the project reaches a stable state, with some minimum amount of functionality, the plan is to port it to C++ for comparison purposes, this being the language which is likely to provide the best performance.</p>




<p>I still plan on doing this, but I&rsquo;ve also decided to add a couple of extra candidate languages to the melting pot and get an even broader comparison. The first of these languages is Go, a relatively new language developed at Google. This is not coincidence. I&rsquo;ve been doing some reading about it lately and finding a lot of things I really like. It has the potential to provide the benefits of both Java <em>and</em> C++, whilst avoiding many of the pitfalls. This is definitely a good thing. It will also give me chance to dogfood (there&rsquo;s <a href="/blog/2011/08/26/dogfood-nom-nom-nom/">that word</a> again!) some more Google technology.</p>

  <p>
    <p>You may or may not be aware that, though I now lived in London and previously lived in Edinburgh, I&rsquo;m originally from South Yorkshire. Since I visited my parents this weekend for my father&rsquo;s 60th birthday*, I though I&rsquo;d take a moment to talk about a couple of Yorkshire related titbits which have crossed my mind recently.</p>




<p>The first is the fact that no matter how far you go from your your roots, they have a way of inserting themselves into your life in unexpected places. The other day (or &ldquo;t&#8217;other day&rdquo; if we&rsquo;re going to be properly Yorkshire about this) I was walking through Waterloo train station on my way to meet some friends for dinner. There&rsquo;s a theatre attached to the station which is showing &ldquo;The Railway Children&rdquo;, and thus it has been named &ldquo;The Yorkshire Theatre&rdquo;. Next to the theatre is a booth organised by &ldquo;Visit Yorkshire&rdquo;, which is essentially the Yorkshire Tourist Board. As is often the case with these booths, it has a couple of large posters showing sights intended to entice you to… well… visit Yorkshire.</p>

  <p>
    <p>Dog food, the common noun, is reasonably self explanatory (pro tip: it&rsquo;s food for dogs). Dogfood the verb or dogfooding the verbal noun, though, might require a little bit of explanation.</p>




<p>At the root of it is this: if you make dog food, you should feed it to your own dogs. There are essentially two reasons for this:</p>

    <p>I finally broke.</p>




<p>I’ve been saying for some time that if the Kindle, or a similarly capable eReader, went under the £100 mark I would splash out and buy one. Until quite recently I had been quite tempted, but this condition was never satisfied. Had I seen one for sale in a bricks and mortar store while I was over in the US of A, I think I probably would have just snapped it up, dollar to stirling exchange rates and relative prices being what they are. But I didn’t, so I didn’t.</p>




<p>Then, suddenly, out of the blue, I just happened to be on the Amazon Kindle page by shear chance, in no way fighting the urge to just say “sod it” and bloody well buy one, when I noticed the word “refurbished” in the pricing options. More interesting to me were the numerals to the right of the word. Eighty of your British pounds.</p>

    <p>Well. These are certainly interesting times to be living in London. Interesting times to be living in England full stop, in fact. In particular, I definitely picked an ideal time to move to Clapham.</p>




<p>I have a bad habit of being more or less completely oblivious to what&rsquo;s going on in the world, unless it happens in either the tech or movie industries. I subscribe to those blogs and news sites, but I rarely read the paper or turn on the news, so something has to land with quite a thud, more or less in my lap, for me to notice it much of the time. When a waitress walks into the restaurant in which I&rsquo;m eating and announces that riots have kicked off just outside the station I arrived via around twenty minutes earlier, though, <em>that</em> is something I notice. Likewise, when I can hear the sirens from my bedroom window and see the helicopters flying overhead, I pay attention.</p>

    <p>“Given that you’ve just told us that the second one is one of the worst films you’ve ever seen,” asked Pete, “why on earth did you feel the need to go and see the third one?”</p>




<p>It was a good question. In all fairness I do not have good explanation as to why I paid actual money to see <em>Transformers: Dark of the Moon</em> in the cinema. I suppose I was relying mostly on hope. I mean, we’re talking about a film which is, at its core, about giant robots fighting. It really should be quite hard to get that wrong. The plot doesn’t need to be much, it just has to work. The first Transformers film just about held together, and I had a reasonable amount of fun with it. There was something extremely soulless about it, though. Something clearly went wrong somewhere, but I thought there was potential.</p>




<p>So I went to see the second film. I thought perhaps it would be better. Maybe it would hold on to the good bits of the first film and shore up everything else. It had Tony Todd as the villain, after all. Surely that meant nothing could go wrong?</p>

  <p>
    <p>&hellip;would make significantly more noise than I have on this blog, as of late.</p>




<p>There are a couple of reasons for this. The main one is that I don&rsquo;t actually have the internet in my new flat yet, and won&rsquo;t for another 9 days. Bloody Virgin Media. Serves me right for not going with media which has a bit more experience, I suppose. I&rsquo;m writing this at work, which is something I really don&rsquo;t like to do, but it&rsquo;s very much the end of the day and I&rsquo;m in late because I started late. I figure: a quick post can&rsquo;t hurt.</p>




<p>Another reason is that my life has been incredibly complicated for the last couple of weeks. I have been bounced around all over the place. I also missed a flight, an expensive mistake I may devote a blog entry to at some point, now that my (partially self directed) rage has subsided, since it has some comedy value.</p>

  <p>
    <p>It seems that people really enjoyed my post about the <a href="/blog/2011/06/03/in-which-i-go-full-nerd-2/">computer history museum</a>. At the time I wrote it, I was worried that it might constitute just a little bit too much nerd, so I held back on my initial impulse to put in more pictures and gush enthusiastically about how awesome it all was.</p>




<p>With hindsight, perhaps I can afford to ignore that particular mental stopcock, at least for a little while. I do not, I regret to tell you, have anymore pictures of <em>the</em> teapot. I do intend to buy myself a Melitta teapot at some point quite soon, however, so that it may sit in my flat and act as a most nerdy in-joke.</p>

    <p>If a person were to walk from downtown Mountain View (in so far as Mountain View has a town to be down of) to the Computer History Museum, and then kept going, they might find themselves wandering into Shoreline Business Park. This is where you would find the silicon in this part of the valley.</p>




<p>Of course, there isn&rsquo;t actually a lot of touristing to do in your average industrial park. We&rsquo;re in Silicon Valley here, though, surely there must be something to see? Well&hellip; there are signs for reasonably exciting tech companies, with logos and everything&hellip; for example:</p>

  <p>
    <p>The effort required to actually publish that <a href="http://harveynick.wordpress.com/2011/06/03/in-which-i-go-full-nerd-2/">last post</a> was&hellip; considerable. Several factors contributed to this:</p>




<ul>
<li>I have slow internet access at my hotel;</li>
<li>Currently, my only (full) computer is my work laptop;</li>
<li>This doesn&rsquo;t have iPhoto installed (this is mostly for reasons of simplicity, I&rsquo;d probably get it if I asked).</li>
</ul>




<p>In the end, I wrote the text of the post in Evernote on my iPad (using an external keyboard), since I&rsquo;m supposed to install an absolute minimum of third party software on the laptop. Next, I did a copy paste into BlogPress, a blogging app which lets you insert images inline. In theory the official WordPress app also does this, except that the upload always fails for me. As you may have gathered, I inserted the images here. This also rescales them, so you don&rsquo;t need to upload all 12 megapixels. Next, I uploaded it to my actual blog as a draft, and used the web interface to fix any formatting errors and add any extra formatting, since BlogPress doesn&rsquo;t allow bold or italic text (that I&rsquo;ve found). That done, I hit the publish button, and: presto!</p>

  <p>
    <p>Jet lag is a funny thing. Right now it actually seems to be working in my favour; it&rsquo;s managed to knock a couple of bad habits out of me. Specifically, these happen to be the not entirely unrelated habits of going to bed too late (then making it later by reading for a good long while) and getting up too late. Right now I seem to be fighting to keep my eyes open by around nine, and then being wide awake by seven. Which is more or less the position I found myself in on Sunday. Since day one at Google camp was a couple of days away I thought I&rsquo;d check out my immediate surroundings.</p>




<p>This may come as a bit of a surprise to you, but there isn&rsquo;t actually a lot to do in Mountain View. One of the things there is to do, however, is the computer history museum, which I&rsquo;d been told is exactly as awesome as it sounds. In case my meaning isn&rsquo;t clear: really awesome. There is no sarcasm here. Look at my face. Awesome. This is not my sarcastic face. Awesome. Face. Awesome.</p>

  <h2><a href="/blog/2011/06/02/this-morning/">This Morning.</a></h2>
  
  <p>
    <p>You&rsquo;re going to have to wait a little while longer for the Computer History Museum, Silicon Valley Wandering and San Francisco based updates I had in mind, since I still haven&rsquo;t found a good way of adding the images I wanted to. In the meantime, I thought I&rsquo;d tell you about my morning, in a similar (if significantly smaller in scope) fashion to <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2010/04/12/Google-Vignettes">Tim Bray&rsquo;s semi-famous post</a>.</p>




<p>Now, Google is very transparent internally, but also has fairly strict rules about what you can and can&rsquo;t talk to people about, regardless of whether you&rsquo;re talking to your friends, your family, random people on the street, or potentially random people on the information super highway (that&rsquo;s you). I haven&rsquo;t entirely gotten my head around them yet, so I&rsquo;m limiting myself to things you could find out by yourself, either via the internet, by wandering around in the general vicinity of a Google office, or being invited in as a lunch guest. This latter option is not too uncommon; it&rsquo;s actually something we&rsquo;re encouraged to do (up to a point).</p>

  <p>
    <p>Most people can definitively trace at least one or two traits directly back to one of their parents. In my case I can definitely lay the blame for two at the feet of my father:</p>




<ol>
<li> I know the rules of cricket inside out;</li>
<li> Walking right across town doesn&rsquo;t faze me in the slightest.</li>
</ol>




<p>The first isn&rsquo;t really important right now (unless you need to know the specifics of the leg before wicket rule STAT), while the second is the result of a father who likes to walk. A lot. In fact many of my childhood holidays consisted of a series of walks across various British cities, often culled from the pages of an impressively large (and impressively modular) Reader&rsquo;s Digest walkers guide&hellip; to British cities.</p>

  <p>
    <p>I can see the mountains, but I suppose that&rsquo;s only to be expected. I am in Mountain View, after all.</p>




<p>As of today, I&rsquo;m in Silicon Valley for my &ldquo;noogler training,&rdquo; something which most companies would just refer to as an induction. At Google, though, there&rsquo;s a bit more to it than that. There are a lot of tools and technologies to learn, because so much of what we use is built in house, and there is a lot of culture to adapt to, because most companies don&rsquo;t function the way Google functions. Hence, all new hires get shipped over to the mothership, partly to centralise all of this learning, and partly (I suspect) because the Googleplex is really, really cool. I&rsquo;ve been told I must try all of the cafes and slides.</p>

    <p>I&rsquo;m reading a Peter F Hamilton book right now. His work isn&rsquo;t perfect, but I like it. He achieves a fairly staggering level of scale, whilst corralling a considerable number of characters who are worth your time* and develop naturally, if exceptionally. His books are, however, frikkin&#8217; gigantic. This one is 725 pages long, and is shorter than a lot of his other work. It&rsquo;s not ideal for reading on journeys, and you wouldn&rsquo;t want to pack more than one of them for a long trip. It&rsquo;s also not like PFH is the only long winded author I read. See also Robyn Hobb, Neal Stephenson and Brandon Sanderson. I don&#8217;t <em>only</em> read huge Sci-Fi/Fantasy epics, but I do <em>often</em> read them.</p>




<p>Additionally, I have stacks and stacks of books, even taking into account that I divested myself of a lot before leaving Edinburgh. When I move into my new flat**, I&rsquo;m not sure I&rsquo;m going to have space for them. If I could stop that collection growing too much, that would be ideal, but I have no plans to stop reading or buying new reading material.</p>

  <p>
    <p>This is going to be short. Suffice to say: almost everything you&rsquo;ve heard about working for Google is true. That being the case, there is no slide in my office. I&rsquo;m told they have them in Mountain View and Zurich, however, and I&rsquo;ll apparently be visiting both this year (Mountain View next week!).</p>




<p>The food / restaurants / kitchens are awesome in a &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve thought of everything you need&rdquo; kind of way. The people are really nice, but also intimidatingly smart. For a tech firm, a lot of them are girls as well, which makes for a more balanced working environment.</p>




<p>On the whole it was a good first day, though mostly consisting of administration. I&rsquo;m itching to get into the code!</p>

    <p>Yes. That&rsquo;s right. I did it. I used a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sed">sed</a> expression as post title.</p>




<p>I&rsquo;ve been very quiet as of late, though in my defence I&rsquo;ve been very busy for a few months. In the middle of that I had a potentially life changing decision to make, and then I was dealing with the ramifications of the choice I made.</p>




<p>As you may have gathered from the post title (even if it mostly looks like crazy speak to you), the choice was whether I should accept a job at Google or not. Believe it or not, it was a choice, and a fairly hard one. There are various reasons for this. I&rsquo;m not going to go into all of them, though I will go into some, but let&rsquo;s start with a little bit of background.</p>

  <h2><a href="/blog/2011/03/24/features/">Features</a></h2>
  
  <p>
    <p>So, in my <a href="http://harveynick.wordpress.com/2011/03/14/brave-new-worlds/">last post</a> I remarked that for procedurally generated landscapes to be interesting, they would need features. But what sort of features was I talking about? Population centres, in particular, tend to to be found close to certain kinds of&hellip; things. The first of these which always comes to my mind is the &ldquo;defensible position.&rdquo; Something like, say, Edinburgh Castle.</p>

  <p>
    <p>If you were writing a taxonomy of stories you might choose books as a good place to start. Flicking your way through the world&rsquo;s libraries, time and the Dewey Decimal System would eventually bring you to the fantasy genre. There is a lot of fantasy writing out there, and you might choose to subdivide it further. A one potential way of cutting it neatly in twain is like so:</p>




<ol>
<li> Stories set in our world;</li>
<li> Stories not set in our world.</li>
</ol>




<p>Simple. Harry Potter, for instance, is set in our world. That&rsquo;s a big part of the appeal. Likewise so are <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Neverwhere-Authors-Preferred-Neil-Gaiman/dp/0755322800/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1300142138&amp;sr=8-1">Neverwhere</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Kraken-China-Mieville/dp/0330492322/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1300142157&amp;sr=1-1">Kracken</a> (if you like&rsquo;d Neverwhere, you&rsquo;ll want to read this), and most of Stephen King&rsquo;s work. Lord of the Rings is not set in our world. Simple. There are other options, of course. What about the  Chronicles of Narnia, for example (which is set in a world beyond our own)? Or Magic Bites* (which is set in an alternate version of our world)? Clearly we&rsquo;re looking at some shades of grey here as well, but I&rsquo;m sticking the with the original idea while it still serves my purpose.</p>

    <p>What, in your opinion, qualifies something as a good advert? Answers on postcard, or alternatively in the comments section below, if you find that easier.</p>




<p>In the technical sense the main thing is surely that you actually end up buying the product in question. In terms of absolute results, I suspect that subtlety is probably key. If an advert manages to plant the suggestion that you want to buy something without ever making you feel advertised to, then it&rsquo;s likely to achieve its goals. The problem is that if a person realises this is happening then a fairly strong negative reaction might result, and they might not buy your product out of spite. For example, I&rsquo;ll probably never buy anything I see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derren_Brown">Derren Brown</a> holding, just in case.</p>

  <p>
    <p>If you know when I started my PhD you&rsquo;ll be aware that it took quite some time for me to finish it. There are various reasons for this. One is that I spent quite a bit of time working and getting industrial experience during it. The other is that it took me something in the region of 18 months to figure out what it was I was actually going to do. This happens quite a bit at the Ocean Systems Laboratory, you don&rsquo;t actually start working on a particular project or problem, you just sort of find something which seems to need doing. It also didn&rsquo;t help that it talk me 9 months to get any feedback on the first draft of my thesis. One of the major things which took up my time, though, was the Student Autonomous Underwater Challenge &ndash; Europe, or SAUC-E for short.</p>




<p>This post is going to focus on my own part in the proceedings, but you should assume that everyone else on the teams worked at least as hard as I did, and their contribution was at least as important as my own. This is <em>my</em> blog, though, so I&rsquo;ll mainly be talking about me.</p>

  <p>
    <p>Okay, so there has been a shameful lack of posts here in recent weeks, and for that I apologise. I&rsquo;ve had some stuff going on in both my personal and professional lives, and so this blog has really been put on the back burner. I swear to you that there is more coming, though, and soon. I have a fairly large and media laden post which is mostly written, but not yet bloggified, for instance. In the mean time, how about a small diversion?</p>




<p>Even if you know me in real life, you might not be aware of this small fact, for which I feel no shame whatsoever:</p>




<blockquote><p>Spider-man is my favourite fictional character.</p></blockquote>

  <p>
    <p>Since I haven&rsquo;t been able to do any actual work on my Clockwork Aphid project as of late, I suppose I may as well talk about the background behind it a little more. Those who talk about it the most are the ones doing it the least, and all that. I&rsquo;ve spoken a little about virtual worlds before and focussed <a href="http://harveynick.wordpress.com/2010/10/08/wow-oh-wow/">almost entirely</a> on World of Warcraft, because it&rsquo;s a the big one. It&rsquo;s not the only MMORPG, and it definitely wasn&rsquo;t the first. It is the one that I have most experience with, and statistically the one most other people are likely to have experience with, as well.</p>




<p>There are several other virtual worlds I really should talk about, but the elephant in the room is another extremely large, and very notable, virtual world. One which has double relevance, because I&rsquo;ve made an oblique reference to it already in <a href="http://harveynick.wordpress.com/2010/10/19/youre-speaking-my-landscape-baby/">another post</a>.</p>

  <p>
    <p>If you&rsquo;re reading this blog and don&rsquo;t actually know me in the real world then you might be wondering &ldquo;who actually is this guy?&rdquo; and possibly even &ldquo;what is it that he actually does, aside from starting to talk about procedural landscape generation, and then falling suddenly silent?&rdquo; Well, clearly I&rsquo;m a person who is currently coming to the end of a PhD, and I have a full time job. But doing what, exactly?</p>




<p>If in fact you do know me in the real world, you still might be wondering about that.</p>




<p>For the most part, what I do is work with Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs), either at the <a href="http://osl.eps.hw.ac.uk/">Ocean Systems Laboratory</a> or <a href="http://www.seebyte.com/">SeeByte Ltd</a>, depending on which hat I&rsquo;m wearing. Let&rsquo;s talk a little about that now, in general terms. Or rather, let&rsquo;s watch an educational video about it.</p>

    <p>That important thing I was talking about <a href="http://harveynick.wordpress.com/2010/11/03/a-short-note-regarding-the-deafening-silence/">before</a>? It was my PhD viva, and it happened last Friday. Remember, remember, the fifth of November, indeed. It&rsquo;s possibile that given time I&rsquo;ll look back upon it as a positive experience (as many others do), but right now I&rsquo;m still reeling a little. The closest thing I can compare it to is a <em>really</em> intense job interview. A job interview which lasted four and a half hours. One which is comparable in intensity to&hellip; say&hellip; one of the boardroom sessions at the end of each episode of The Apprentice. Okay, it&rsquo;s possible that I&rsquo;m overstating things a little here, but you weren&rsquo;t <em>there</em>, man!</p>

  <p>
    <p>For a while there it really looked as though I was on top of this whole blogging lark, didn&rsquo;t it?</p>




<p>The problem is that writing this blog (and to an even greater extent, working on the Clockwork Aphid project) doesn&rsquo;t feel like procrastinating. It feels like doing something. Not working exactly, but definitely making an active contribution.</p>




<p>As a result, if there&rsquo;s something else I&rsquo;m supposed to be doing with my time, I have a really hard time working on either without the guilt setting in (it&rsquo;s happening right now). This doesn&rsquo;t stop me from dicking around on the web, complaining about the latest change to Facebook and working my way through my mountain of articles which get dumped into my RSS reader on a daily basis, of course. They do feel like procrastinating, you see, so I waste plenty of time doing those.</p>

  <p>
    <p>The return train ride after a visit to my parents&#8217; house is, if anything, more pleasant that the outward journey. This is not least, of course, because it ends in Edinburgh, rather than <em>Doncaster</em>*. Be that as it may, this is perhaps a good time to pick up the thought I left hanging at the end of my <a href="http://harveynick.wordpress.com/2010/10/26/the-journey-home/">last entry</a>, in which I talked a little about ways of keeping notes and writing down ideas. Having dealt with information, we now come to action. From stasis, to process. Less obliquely: what, exactly, are you going to do about those ideas?</p>




<p>For the longest time I never kept todo lists. I tried to keep my goals and the individual steps required to reach them inside my head. Sometimes this worked quite well; thoughts are things which are simple to rearrange and update as requirements change, after all. Other times, not so much. In short: I forgot things.</p>

<p>You know, the train journey from Edinburgh to Doncaster is really quite beautiful, for the most part. A reasonable amount of it happens within sight of the sea and most of the rest passes through open country. The Yorkshire dales is a landscape I find quite pleasing to look out over, unless I&rsquo;m driving through it, in which case I find to to mostly feel endless. Some of the towns you pass through have more charm than others, of course. Newcastle isn&rsquo;t without its fans, and Berwick-Upon-Tweed is gorgeous, but I can&rsquo;t see anyone wanting to put <em>Doncaster</em> on a postcard any time soon.</p>

  <p>
    <p>Some of the particularly sharp/anal ones amongst you might have noticed that while the technique for generating fractal lanscapes I <a href="http://harveynick.wordpress.com/2010/10/19/youre-speaking-my-landscape-baby/">previously described</a> works (and works well), it&rsquo;s not 100% <em>correct</em>. Specifically, the fact that it uses the the same scaling factor for nodes created by the diamond and square steps isn&rsquo;t quite right.</p>

    <p>It took a little bit of fighting with bugs that weren&rsquo;t showing up in the 2D view, and a bit of time to figure out what was going on with the lighting system in <a href="http://www.jmonkeyengine.org/">JME</a>, but I finally got the 3D display of the <a href="http://harveynick.wordpress.com/2010/10/20/some-random-landscapes/">fractal</a> working.</p>




<p>The first stage was just displaying each node as a discrete point so I could see that each was in about the right place. It looks a little bit like this:</p>

    <p>I&rsquo;m currently doing some tests on a couple of different data structure implementations for Clockwork Aphid, so while they&rsquo;re running I thought I&rsquo;d a bit of time to write a music related post, since I haven&rsquo;t done one in a while. So, contained within are three music related mini posts for your viewing pleasure.</p>

  <p>
    <p>A couple nuggets of knowledge came out of my &ldquo;You&rsquo;re Speaking My Language, Baby&rdquo; series of posts, so I though I&rsquo;d just take a quick moment to talk about them.</p>




<p>The first two are perhaps the most obvious by far. Firstly: if you actually write blog posts, people are more likely to read your blog. Funny that, huh? While my post on installing <a href="/blog/2008/08/24/mdl-celtx-on-the-acer-aspire-one/">Celtx on the Acer Aspire one</a> is still my most popular by some margin (probably because it actually provides some utility), I actually had my highest numbers of hits per day during the last week. Secondly: I get less hits over the weekend. Lax working habits for the win!</p>

    <p>As I&rsquo;ve previously mentioned, my project (Clockwork Aphid) has been bubbling away in the bearded cauldron that is my head for quite some time. As a result, I have quite a bit I want to say about it. I want to blog about the process of building it because I think it might be a good exercise to go through, and also because I think it might help me work the whole thing out. I&rsquo;m going to talk more about what it actually is quite soon, partly because I want to start talking about implementation and partly because I&rsquo;ve been prompted by someone else&rsquo;s project which I suspect might be quite similar. More about that later.</p>

    <p>So&hellip; what&rsquo;s the conclusion? It mostly comes back to the fact that I&rsquo;m doing this mainly for fun (though you may have trouble believing it). That being the case I&rsquo;m going to start working in Java. In fact I already have started working in Java, and I&rsquo;ve already written the first bits of code. I&rsquo;ll talk about and make them available soon.</p>

  <p>
    <p>The last language I&rsquo;m considering is <strong>Objective-C</strong>. I know this language the least of three. To make matters worse, while Java and C++ share a similar syntax, Objective-C is completely different in places. That being said, it&rsquo;s semantically very similar to Java (more so than C++) and people who know it well speak very highly of it. i.e. it does not appear to be anywhere near as broken as C++. The language itself has some dynamic capability built in, but also has all of the additional dynamic options available to C++ (more on that later) and an excellent Ruby implementation which sits directly on top of the Objective-C runtime (<a href="http://www.macruby.org/">MacRuby</a>).</p>

  <p>
    <p>The second language I&rsquo;m considering is <strong>C++</strong>. This is the language that I use the most at my day job. It&rsquo;s also the language that&rsquo;s used to build the vast majority of computer games and one hell of a lot of commercial software. I&rsquo;m not as familiar with it as I am with Java, but I know it well enough to be productive with it. I&rsquo;m also familiar enough with it to know how horribly <a href="http://yosefk.com/c++fqa/">broken</a> it is in many respects. One of the major design goals of Java (among other more modern programming languages) was to fix the problems with C++. It also has no dynamic capabilities what-so-ever, but it&rsquo;s possible to paper over this by using a minimal dynamic runtime such as <a href="http://www.lua.org/">Lua</a> for scripting.</p>

  <p>
    <p>The first language I&rsquo;m considering is <strong>Java</strong>. This is by far the language I&rsquo;m most comfortable and proficient with. It was used for about 90% of my Bachelors degree, I wrote the entire codebase of my PhD using it, and it gets used here and there in my day job. I&#8217;m comfortable with Java, and find it to be quite a pleasant language to program in. Big tick on the question regarding my ability to use it, then. Java has some modest dynamic capabilities built in, but it also has a lot of small options for using higher level languages for the scripting, the cleanest of which is possibly Groovy.</p>

  <p>
    <p>If you&rsquo;re about to start on a programming project of some sort (and I am), then the first choice you have to make is the main programming language you&rsquo;re going to use. Now, if you&rsquo;re carrying out this project on your employers time they probably have very specific views about that. I&rsquo;m not doing this project on company time, though, so the world is my oyster, figuratively speaking. There are, at a rough guess, shit loads of programming languages out there. There&rsquo;s a reasonably good list to be found <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_programming_languages">here</a>, though it is missing a couple of the weird ones. While constructing the project using a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LOLCODE">language</a> which uses LOL cat type speech for syntax, or takes its input in the form of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piet_(programming_language)">abstract art</a> would be an excellent mental challenge, I&rsquo;m sure, that&rsquo;s just not what I&rsquo;m looking for.</p>

  <p>
    <p>Sooner or later, most people go looking for a bit of escapism every once in a while. There&rsquo;s definitely a spectrum of how far people like to escape. Some can&rsquo;t stand anything which steps outside the bounds of the possible, others practically require spaceships and dragons to co-exist with emotionally retarded vampires. Likewise, some people look to books for their diversions, some theatre, radio, television or cinema. Some people play computer games or one sort of another. No one is saying that everyone, or indeed anyone, has make a specific and binding choice, though. You can watch a movie about the emotional and theological struggle of gay monks one evening, read a couple of chapters of a book about an adolescent wizard immediately before bed, and take on the role of a greek god laying waste to&hellip; well&hellip; everything the next day.</p>

    <p>Clockwork Aphid is the name I&rsquo;m giving to a side project I&rsquo;ve had sitting at the back of head for a little while. I&rsquo;m actually going to try and build it now.

  <p>
    <p>Strangely, I don&rsquo;t think my good lady actually thought I&rsquo;d attempt to make any of the actual recipes when she bought me a copy of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heston_Blumenthal">Heston Blumenthal</a>&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Further-Adventures-Search-Perfection-Blumenthal/dp/0747594058/ref=pd_bxgy_b_img_b">Further Adventures in Search of Perfection</a>&rdquo; for Christmas last year. Sometimes I worry about how little she appears to know me. A chili con carne recipe which takes three days to prepare is exactly the sort of challenge I&rsquo;m practically incapable of resisting. A black forest gateau that requires the use of a hoover? I say &ldquo;bring it on!&rdquo;</p>




<p>I do intend to have a crack at those ones, but I thought I&rsquo;d ease my way in with the Bolognese recipe from &ldquo;<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Search-Perfection-Heston-Blumenthal/dp/0747584095">In Search of Perfection</a>,&rdquo; which takes a mere ten hours to prepare and requires no special tools.</p>

  <p>
    <p>One of the few things I&rsquo;ve missed since abandoning the good ship Windows PC for the Mac&hellip; er&hellip; Zeppelin (why not?) is magazines. I used to really enjoy reading the PC gaming and hardware mags. Oftentimes they were pitched at about the right level for me. I felt neither patronised nor confused. I&rsquo;m afraid to say that this is not the case with Mac magazines. For the most part they tend to aim a little low, tech wise (no kidding, right?). I did also try Linux magazines, but generally found them to be way too dry and not especially well written. Once again, quelle surprise. Quelle surprise beaucoup.</p>

  <p>
    <p>Further to my last post, here&rsquo;s a couple more films which caught my eye, though one of them is a ways off yet.</p>




<p>Faster (<a href="http://trailers.apple.com/trailers/independent/faster/">trailer</a>) &ndash; I will go and see Dwayne Johnson in any film which doesn&rsquo;t involve him wearing a tutu or fairy wings. Perhaps even then, and you can quote me on that. The guy has more charisma and physical presence than just about everyone else out there, and is (as far as I&rsquo;m concerned) always good value for money, regardless of the quality of the actual film. Frankly, the guy should be a much bigger start than he is. That he&rsquo;s in an indie revenge flick makes me very happy indeed. Also: great trailer.</p>

    <p>The Cineworld unlimited card is a wonderful thing, especially given that I no longer have a student card (I am still a student, technically. Don&rsquo;t ask). It encourages you to take a much more &ldquo;what the hell,&rdquo; type attitude to heading to the cinema, and I love me some cinema. That being the case, I thought I&rsquo;d write a (probably) quick post covering the films coming out this year that I&rsquo;m pretty certain I&rsquo;ll be going to see.</p>

    <p>As you may or may not know, I&rsquo;m currently in Australia. In fact, I&rsquo;ve now been here for a little over a month. I&rsquo;ll blog about it sooner or later, but not yet. This is largely because I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;m going to say. This trip has been an alarming combination of coolness and frustration so far, and I don&rsquo;t want to let too much of the later slip out. That would be highly unprofessional of me, and possibly not great either for my employer or my career.</p>




<p>This post shall be about something else.</p>

  <p>
    <p>Every once in a while, a film trailer comes along that I can’t seem to stop myself watching repeatedly. I like trailers in general, which is definitely part of the problem, but some of them really grab hold of me. Two good examples of this are the final theatrical trailer for the recent <a href="http://trailers.apple.com/trailers/paramount/startrek/">Star Trek reboot</a>, and one of the trailers for <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9tnZRs4tNE">The Two Towers</a> (the one with the orchestral version of he awesome theme song from Requiem for a Dream, and words cannot express how disappointed I was when that music wasn’t in the actual film).</p>

  <p>
    <p>Something I forgot to mention in my last post was my trying to look at the iPad from a developer&rsquo;s perspective. I talked before about a programming side project that I&rsquo;ve had bouncing around in my head for a while. Previously, I mentioned that I wasn&rsquo;t sure if it was a website, an application, or some combination of the two. Then again I could see some use cases in which a laptop might be a bit cumbersome and a smart phone too small and underpowered. In which case neither the application of the website is entirely satisfactory. I&rsquo;m actually now starting to think that the iPad could be the exact right platform for it. Perhaps I should actually start working my way through the Objective-C text book I&rsquo;ve had sitting on my shelf for over a year now&hellip;</p>

  <p>
    <p>Originally, right after I got around the watching the keynote presentation which launched the iPad, I was going to write a blog post about how disappointed I was. I thought they&rsquo;d screwed the pooch and I, for one, was seriously underwhelmed.</p>




<p>Needless to say, I didn&rsquo;t quite get around to writing it. Since then I&rsquo;ve read all the criticism by the naysayers and Apple haters, all the gushing praise from the fanatics and all the stuff in between from the more sensible people*. Now, after some reflection, I find myself somewhere in the middle. I flip back and forwards between thoughts of &ldquo;that could be awesome,&rdquo; and &ldquo;that&rsquo;s far too much of a compromise.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hhhmmm&hellip; perhaps I should explain&hellip;</p>




<p>It&rsquo;s reached that time. My computer is starting to show it&rsquo;s age. In small ways, mostly. It stalls occasionally, but with gradually increasing frequency. Every now and then it&rsquo;s slow down noticeably, and the fans are spending more and more time going full blast. If it actually died on me that would a <em>disaster </em>right now, but I&rsquo;m not too worried about that just yet. Even so, I think it&rsquo;s time that it had a worthy heir.</p>

    <p>Today I finished &ldquo;The Girl Who Played With Fire&rdquo;, translated by Reg Keeland from the swedish book of the same name by Stieg Larsson. It&rsquo;s the sequel to &lsquo;The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo&#8221; (which is called &ldquo;Men Who Hate Women&rdquo; in the original swedish), and I really can&rsquo;t recommend the pair of them highly enough (as you might have guessed from the title of this blog post).</p>

  <p>
    <p>It has been, by my count, at least 18 months since I last had a holiday (aside from one weekend spent in Cardiff). It&rsquo;s getting to the point where I&rsquo;m starting to feel that I really need a one. But what <em>kind</em> of holiday?</p>




<p>Having stopped to think about it, I&rsquo;ve realised that most of the holidays I&rsquo;ve taken have been of the package type. With the skiing holidays this isn&rsquo;t so bad, it&rsquo;s possibly even ideal. The rest of the time&hellip; not so much. It feels a little too much like being cattle, it feels very lowest common denominator (largely because it is) and you&rsquo;ll tend to spend a lot of time around <em>British Tourists</em> (if you know what I mean). The holidays I remember enjoying most are the other kind. The ad hoc ones. Three stand out.</p>

  <p>
    <p>While it&rsquo;s a fairly common and reasonably accurate maxim that you have to spend money to make money, I find myself wondering if the same is true of energy. To reword and disentangle the metaphor: Can you save energy by using energy?</p>




<p>Here&rsquo;s a my train of thought: You have curtains in your house. It&rsquo;s possible to fit a motorised unit and automate the opening and closing of the same. This would same ostentatious, lazy and wasteful. To have a computer, sitting, always on, in your house, which decides when this should happen would seem to increase these negative factors.</p>

    <p>Today I was walking home from work and absent-mindedly listening to music, when I noticed that that my supposedly shuffled iPod was displaying a definite preference for one band in particular. A band I haven&rsquo;t really spared a seconds thought in some years. As I walked I hatched a plot a write a blog post regarding the nostalgia this inspired. So I arrived home and thought to have a look on youTube for some reference material to post&hellip;</p>

  <p>
    <p>So I like computer games. This isn&rsquo;t news, really. Not in a hardcore live-to-game type way, more in a general fondness type way. That said, I did, as a youngster in an age before mobile phones, catch a bus to the next town so I could play a particular arcade game in what was (on reflection) a seriously dodgy little shop. That game was Street Fighter 2. It was a pretty great game, and it pretty much changed everything as far as the gaming industry was concerned. It spawned a bunch of sort of sequels which were mostly very popular, a couple of prequels, which were also very popular, and an actual sequel&hellip; which ditched most of the characters people loved and wasn&rsquo;t quite as popular.</p>

  <p>
    <p>I like bread. I like it lot. So I was quite pleased when my parents gave me their bread machine and associated recipe book a couple of years ago. Their reasoning was (believe it or not) that I was the only one actually able to make bread with it. Their own attempts closely resembled articles suitable for construction, rather than ones suitable for mastication.</p>




<p>So I&rsquo;ve used it on and off since then. Sometimes the bread was good (the sweet potato bread, for example, is awesome), sometimes it was bad (chick pea bread: no, no, no). Just lately I&rsquo;ve been using it with renewed vigour, since I&rsquo;ve resolved to avoid mass produced bread. Why (you might ask)? The short answer is that the methods used are damaging to the environment, in some respects the economy, and also to the digestive tract of the person who consumes it (which in my case would be me). The long answer is <a href="http://www.dolectures.co.uk/speakers/andrew-whitley">here</a>.</p>

  <p>
    <p>I haven&rsquo;t blogged in some, so it seemed only natural that I should do the churlish thing and write about items I would like, but do not have, post Christmas.</p>




<p>First of all is a pod based coffee maker. When walking through House of Fraiser pre Christmas my beautiful and wonderful girlfriend had cause to exclaim &ldquo;These are so cool*!&rdquo; What she was talking about was a Nespresso machine (or more precisely a table full of them). Basically you pop a little pod of coffee in the top, push a button and really quite good espresso (or something a lot like it) comes out of the spout. Boom. Simple and fast, without any fuss or the need to do much in the way of cleaning. This appeals to me. A lot.</p>

  <p>
    <p>Dear Road User,</p>




<p>Should you be located in the UK and in possession of an automobile, you may have noticed a strange lever positioned to the left of your steering wheel (the circular device which changes the direction of your car). If you are of the inquisitive sort you may have also discovered a causal relationship (or at least a very strong correlation) between pushing this appendage in either of the upwards or downwards directions, and the flashing of two sets of orange lights positioned down the sides of your car.</p>

    <p>Helen&rsquo;s comment on my previous entry put me in mind of what I&rsquo;ve felt as the Scottish attitude towards England and the English more or less ever since I arrived here (seven years ago!). It goes something like this:</p>




<blockquote><p>The English? Bastards! We hate &lsquo;em! Oh, but we&rsquo;re not talking about you, of course. Dear me, no. More tea? Scone?</p></blockquote>

  <p>
    <p>So.</p>




<p>It&rsquo;s not that I feel that Bristol is an intrinsically bad or depressing place. My attitude to it was coloured by the fact that I was a little tired of travelling, tired in general and didn&rsquo;t entirely want to be there. Also, and this is the key fact, I&rsquo;d just got back from Iceland. I liked Iceland a lot, despite the twelve hour days I felt almost no stress the entire I was there. There&rsquo;s something very chilled about the place, and there was almost no traffic congestion, even considering that we drove through the middle of Reykjavik every morning during hush hour. But there&rsquo;s something else.</p>

  <p>
    <p>I&rsquo;ve been traveling around for work for the vast majority of the last month, so generally speaking I&rsquo;ve been anything but at a loose end. Evenings were full of work or spent with the colleagues / friends I was traveling with. But now I&rsquo;m back and finding that I don&rsquo;t know what to do with myself a lot of the time. It&rsquo;s giving me time to think about things, and that never ends well.</p>

  <p>
    <p>&hellip;In Iceland!</p>




<p>I wanted to come here for a long time (this is no secret), and as the result of a highly unsubtle campaign of strategic hint dropping, here I find myself. It&rsquo;s not under ideal circumstances, though. I&rsquo;m here for work and so I&rsquo;ll be spending most of my time working 12 hour days, doing fiddly embedded computer programming and ridding about in boats waiting for robots to do their thing. I&rsquo;m also here with my boss (or someone far higher up the chain of command than myself, at least), and though he&rsquo;s a really nice guy there&rsquo;s always going to be a significant disconnect. He&rsquo;s not my first choice(s)* to share this experience with. I&rsquo;d rather be here with my friends. My friends are awesome, you see.</p>

  <p>
    <p>So I managed to get the Celtx screenwriting (and general preproduction) software up and running on my shiny new AA1, and in the interests of sharing the knowledge I thought I&rsquo;d post how I did it. Please note, this should also work as general recipe for installing any software not available under the package manager in Linpus Light Linux (provided there are no additional dependencies).</p>




<p>First of all you need to download the software from the downloads page of the Celtx website, <a href="http://www.celtx.com/download.html">here</a>. I&rsquo;d recomend getting the straight up Linux version in your choice of language (frustratingly there is no option for British English, though). There is an Asus eee specific version, but that just clears up some dependencies and doesn&rsquo;t really provide you with anything extra.</p>

    <p>My good friend Dougal got himself an Asus eee pc (relatively) recently. He likes it a lot. I like the idea of it, but not so much the implementation. On his version at least, the screen is too small for me, and the later versions are a bit too pricey. I love the idea of a small, light and eminently carriable laptop though. It&rsquo;s the premise I originally bought my MacBook under, but I found even that machine to be too bulky and heavy to carry around constantly. The MacBook Air might work, but it&rsquo;s very expensive (from the direction I&rsquo;m looking at it from, anyway) and not really something I&rsquo;d be prepared to pull out of my bag and start working on while sitting on the Meadows.</p>

  <p>
    <p>On Friday night I went to the Silent Disco and danced away until 4 am. On the whole I think it was excellent. I think it (or some progression of it) might well be the future of night clubs. It was £10 entry, which might seem a little expensive, but is really no more than the entry to a lot of clubs in Edinburgh. The music was also quite mainstream, and not the hardcore dance I was expecting, which is good because I think his sort of thing is a lot more fun when you can shout along with the words. Especially when you can take of your headphones and watch everyone dancing away without there being any apparent music.</p>

    <p>Seems the Facebook app does not do what it&rsquo;s supposed to. Never mind, I shall content myself with the (better) Wordpress interface. Maybe I&rsquo;ll look into writing a Facebook app which interfaces with my RSS feed. That would be cool.</p>




<p>I thought I would write a music related post, since I found a couple of things on YouTube which piqued my interest. First an entirely serious one:</p>

    <p>Blogging.</p>




<p>By my count I&rsquo;ve had three previous attempts (on different services), none of which has entirely worked out. The problems which cause this to be are multiple, but two in particular tend to stand out. Firstly, I tend to write long rambling posts which take a lot of effort, and secondly I tend to not believe that anyone is actually reading them.</p>
