    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A couple nuggets of knowledge came out of my &#8220;You&#8217;re Speaking My Language, Baby&#8221; series of posts, so I though I&#8217;d just take a quick moment to talk about them.</p>

<p>The first two are perhaps the most obvious by far. Firstly: if you actually write blog posts, people are more likely to read your blog. Funny that, huh? While my post on installing <a href="http://harveynick.com/blog/2008/08/24/mdl-celtx-on-the-acer-aspire-one/">Celtx on the Acer Aspire one</a> is still my most popular by some margin (probably because it actually provides some utility), I actually had my highest numbers of hits per day during the last week. Secondly: I get less hits over the weekend. Lax working habits for the win!</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>What&#8217;s also interesting is the relative popularity of the individual parts of the series. Most popular first, it goes like this:</p>

<ol>
<li>Introduction</li>
<li>C++</li>
<li>Conclusion</li>
<li>Java</li>
<li>Objective-C</li>
</ol>


<p><span class='pullquote-right' data-pullquote='when it comes to specifics, C++ gets the most interest'>
Now, my number of hits still isn&#8217;t exactly stellar, so this is a fairly small sample size, but it&#8217;s still quite interesting. People seem to be far more interested in reading about C++ than any of the other languages. In general, readers tend to want to know what it is I&#8217;m actually talking about, and what conclusion I come to, but when it comes to specifics, C++ gets the most interest. Is this a recommendation of the language, or the oposite, though? People could be reading what I say about it because they think it&#8217;s the sensible option&#8230; or because the folly of the language makes them seethe with rage. Hard to say. Perhaps I&#8217;ll look for some metrics of programming language popularity online.<br/>
</span></p>

<p>In one of those curious events the internet throws up, the writer of a blog I read on a regular basis also just started to work on a project of a potentially similar nature, and started off with some musings on which programming language to use. I&#8217;m talking about Shamus Young in his <a href="http://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?p=9644">Twenty Sided</a> blog (I should really add it to my blog roll). Interestingly, and slightly comically, he came came to an equal and oposite conclusion to my own. He didn&#8217;t consider Objective-C (not out loud, anyway), but decided that Java was the language to use if he wanted to produce something with commercial viability, but C++ was the language to use if he wanted to do some prototyping.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m still scratching my head at this in some ways. I don&#8217;t care how much experience you have in C++, you&#8217;re still likely to program faster in almost any language other than C. But in other ways it makes perfect sense. He has about a decade&#8217;s worth of experience with C++ (likewise I have about ten years worth of Java under my belt), but only limited exposure to Java. He&#8217;s looking at building a complete game, so he&#8217;s being influenced by games like <a href="http://www.minecraft.net/">Minecraft</a> (which I will be talking about more later) which were successfully developed by an individual (in Java, as I understand it). If you&#8217;re making something a bit niche and you don&#8217;t have massive amounts of resources, then having a game which can be effortlessly ported to every major operating system is a good thing. You want to expand you potential audience as much as possible. Also, if your target demographic slants towards the nerd side of the spectrum then you don&#8217;t want count out Linux, nor OSX (which gets more nerd love than you might expect). Having your game be able to run out of a browser doesn&#8217;t hurt, either.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not (at this point) looking at building a complete game, but a piece of technology which could potentially be used by multiple games, though. Something of the order of a physics engine. Middleware is the term I seem to hear used. Thus Java (which I have more experience with) is my prototyping language, but C++ makes sense as an eventual target.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been holding back on what I&#8217;m actually doing, but I essentially outed myself when I said it was similar to what Shamus is. So: I&#8217;m doing something connected to procedural content generation. I&#8217;ll explain more about what that means as I go along.</p>

<p>In other news I have two weeks off work. Seems I haven&#8217;t used the vast majority of my holidays this year and taking the entire month of December off is not considered to be ideal. Thus: I have two weeks to do with as I please. I may visit my parents or even some of my friends down south. I&#8217;ll also spend quite a bit of time sitting in coffee shops with a book and a note pad. Coffee shops are good places to think, I find. Just the right amount of bussle. I&#8217;m also going to crack on with Clockwork Aphid. I&#8217;m tinkering with some implementation details at the moment, but I plan on writing about what I have so far as well. I&#8217;m also hoping to make the Heston Blumenthal chilli con carne I mentioned in a <a href="http://harveynick.com/blog/2010/08/24/its-hestontastic/">previous post</a>, but there are complications. Firstly, he&#8217;s quite specific about the types of chilli powder you should use and some only seem to be available from the good ol&#8217; USA. They&#8217;re on order, so hopefully they&#8217;ll arrive fairly soon. Secondly, there&#8217;s clearly a mistake in the recipe, unless Heston want me to boil a pan of water and prepare a bowl of ice water for purely ornamental purposes. This isn&#8217;t completely outside the bounds of reason.</p>

<p>More updates soon. Look to the skies!</p>

    <updated>2010-10-14T21:22:15+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.harveynick.com/blog/2010/10/14/323</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As I&#8217;ve previously mentioned, my project (Clockwork Aphid) has been bubbling away in the bearded cauldron that is my head for quite some time. As a result, I have quite a bit I want to say about it. I want to blog about the process of building it because I think it might be a good exercise to go through, and also because I think it might help me work the whole thing out. I&#8217;m going to talk more about what it actually is quite soon, partly because I want to start talking about implementation and partly because I&#8217;ve been prompted by someone else&#8217;s project which I suspect might be quite similar. More about that later.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>What to do when something like that happens? I think there are two reactions you can to a situation like that: you can feel threatened; or you can feel vindicated. Clearly the second is the more healthy approach, so I&#8217;ll go with that one. This is probably for the best, since there are other parties who seem to be coming at the same problem as I am. I mentioned at the end of my <a href="http://harveynick.com/blog/2010/10/08/wow-oh-wow/">post</a> about World of Warcraft that I wasn&#8217;t the only one frustrated by the static nature of its world, nor the only one attempting a solution of sorts. Specifically, I was talking about ArenaNet&#8217;s upcoming Guild Wars 2. They&#8217;ll probably explain it a little better than me, so I&#8217;ll let <a href="(http://www.guildwars2.com/en/media/videos/">them</a>):</p>

<p>Now&#8230; clearly they have more resources than I do, which could potentially make me feel a little bit like I was staring up at a shear rock face. A rock face covered in bees. Happily, though, they&#8217;re going about it in a different way, though some of our goals are the same. Guess that means I&#8217;ll just have to come up with some pretty creative solutions, huh?</p>

<p><span class='pullquote-right' data-pullquote='these are the parts with the villages you can actually save'>
It should be noted that what they&#8217;ve essentially done is polarise the world. Parts of it are shared, and these are the parts with the villages you can actually save (or fail to save), while other parts of it are instanced, which means you have your own copy. So if I kill the dragon in one of these parts, it stays dead&#8230; but only in my copy of the world. The dragon in your copy is still alive and kicking until you personally cut its head off / stab it up the bum / jam some opal fruits down its throat. They talk more about the shared, dynamic parts of the world in their blog <a href="http://www.arena.net/blog/colin-johanson-answers-your-dynamic-event-questions">here</a> and <a href="http://www.arena.net/blog/eric-flannum-answers-more-of-your-dynamic-event-questions">here</a>, and the instanced personal stories <a href="http://www.arena.net/blog/ree-soesbee-answers-your-questions-about-gw2-personal-storylines">here</a>. I encourage you to read just about all of that blog, in fact. I found much of it fascinating and quite insightful.<br/>
</span></p>

<p>While, I&#8217;m talking about Guild Wars 2, though it is worth taking a moment to marvel over just how stunning those visuals are. The comparison I find myself making is that World of Warcraft looks like it was made out of clay:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://www.file-extensions.org/imgs/app-picture/3744/world-of-warcraft.jpg"></p>

<p>While Guild Wars 2, on the other hand, looks as though it was made out of china:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://www.guildwars2.com/global/includes/images/screenshots/dynamic-events/gw2-dynamic-006.jpg"></p>

<p>Now before you cry foul and point out that GW2 is a much newer game, it&#8217;s worth taking into account that this china like quality was also true of the original Guild Wars:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://www.guildwars.com/images/screenshots/gwscreen047-page.jpg"></p>

<p>Obviously some of this has to do with the different graphics engines being used, but I think that actual quality of the design is definitely a factor as well. It&#8217;s evident in the 2D promotional art, as well.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m also quite taken with the difference in the mythology of the two games, but perhaps I&#8217;ll talk about that later. Mythology will be quite a relevant subject, later.</p>

    <id>http://www.harveynick.com/blog/2010/10/13/youre-speaking-my-language-baby-part-5-conclusion</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So&#8230; what&#8217;s the conclusion? It mostly comes back to the fact that I&#8217;m doing this mainly for fun (though you may have trouble believing it). That being the case I&#8217;m going to start working in Java. In fact I already have started working in Java, and I&#8217;ve already written the first bits of code. I&#8217;ll talk about and make them available soon.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p><span class='pullquote-right' data-pullquote='Games are among the more demanding things most people do with their computers'>
I just can&#8217;t ignore the sheer applicability of C++, though, much as I may dislike it as a language. Most game developers are going to have the majority of their legacy code written in C++ and that creates a lot of momentum.Games are among the more demanding things most people do with their computers, so they generally try to squeeze every last drop of performance out of the system they&#8217;re running on. C++ does have the potential to provide a performance advantage over Java (even if you might end up loosing that to your AI system when you starting having to use Lua to script behaviours). Another one of the reasons for this project was to create a bit of work which might act sort of like a portfolio piece. So, once the project has reached an early, but functional, stage of development I&#8217;m going to re-implement it in C++ and then see how I feel about the two different implementations before continuing. It&#8217;s not impossible that I&#8217;ll end up keeping both, but more than likely I&#8217;ll kill one and just stick with the other.<br/>
</span></p>

<p>By a process of elimination you might have realised that I&#8217;m now counting Objective-C out. This is true, but I have another side project I may end up using it on. One which lends itself quite well to being either an iPhone/iPad app or a website. Or all three. Objective-C is clearly quite applicable to the first two, and surprisingly applicable to the last, if you go the Objective-C -> MacRuby -> Ruby on Rails route.</p>

<p>That was the plan, at least, until I went ahead and did something silly. I have more than a passing interest in programming language design and so found myself reading about other programming languages. Stupidly, I found a couple which have enough merit that I really can&#8217;t count them out.</p>

<p>The first of these is <a href="http://www.digitalmars.com/d/">D</a>, which is designed to fix a lot of the problems with C++ whilst maintaining its advantages. It seems to succeed at this quite well, so far as I can tell. It also seems to have direct access to a lot of things built directly for C/C++.</p>

<p>Then we have <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/">Scala</a> and <a href="http://fantom.org/">Fantom</a>, which use the Java virtual machine as their runtime. Both seem capable of achieving the same level of performance as Java itself, but take away some of the legacy cruft which Java has been unable to shake, whilst adding extra useful features. Scala I&#8217;m only just starting to learn about, but people seem to like it a lot. Fantom, I think, might be perilously close to being the perfect programming language by many metrics, though. Don&#8217;t take my word for it, have a read about it. I dare you not to be impressed (assuming, of course, that you are the sort of person who gets impressed with these sort of things). It adds some very cool extensions and has direct support for some very useful things, such as allowing both dynamic and static typing under the developer&#8217;s control.</p>

<p>Both Scala and Fantom can transparently use libraries written in Java, though Fantom can also deploy to both .net and javascript (for web development).</p>

<p>All three of the these languages are interesting enough for me for to not count them out entirely, so I might also try a port to one or more of them.</p>

<p>As always, comments are welcome, so please feel free to try and convince me of the error of my ways. Keep it civil, though, I know how excited programming language discussions seem to make some people.</p>

    <link href="http://www.harveynick.com/blog/2010/10/12/youre-speaking-my-language-baby-part-4-objective-c/"/>
    <updated>2010-10-12T12:00:01+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.harveynick.com/blog/2010/10/12/youre-speaking-my-language-baby-part-4-objective-c</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The last language I&#8217;m considering is <strong>Objective-C</strong>. I know this language the least of three. To make matters worse, while Java and C++ share a similar syntax, Objective-C is completely different in places. That being said, it&#8217;s semantically very similar to Java (more so than C++) and people who know it well speak very highly of it. i.e. it does not appear to be anywhere near as broken as C++. The language itself has some dynamic capability built in, but also has all of the additional dynamic options available to C++ (more on that later) and an excellent Ruby implementation which sits directly on top of the Objective-C runtime (<a href="http://www.macruby.org/">MacRuby</a>).</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>In general, Objective-C should be faster than Java, but not as fast as C++. It doesn&#8217;t use a virtual machine, but it does have a minimal run time which is used to implement the more dynamic message passing paradigm it uses in place of standard message calls between objects. It also has optional garbage collection, allowing you to make a choice between stability and performance when you need to (i.e. you can get the code working and worry about the memory allocation later). It&#8217;s also able to leverage all of the power of both the <a href="http://llvm.org/">LLVM</a> back end and the newer <a href="http://clang.llvm.org/">Clang</a> front end, which C++ currently can&#8217;t.</p>

<p>While there aren&#8217;t a lot of directly relevant tools available for Objective-C itself, it is able to directly use any code or library written in either C or C++. No problems there, then.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s the last metric which is the kick in the teeth fot Objective-C, though. In short: no one really uses it unless they&#8217;re programming for an Apple platform. As a result, unless you&#8217;re programming specifically for either OSX or iOS you&#8217;ll loose out on a lot of frameworks. Objective-C is a first class language in the Gnu Compiler Collection (GCC), so it can be deployed easily enough under Linux (minus a lot of the good frameworks). This is not the case under windows, however, where there doesn&#8217;t seem to be any good deployment options. I have no problem ignoring Windows, but directly precluding it would appear to be somewhat foolhardy when building a piece of technology related to computer games. It wouldn&#8217;t be too much of a problem if I was only doing this as an academic exercise, but I actually have delusions of people using it.</p>

    <link href="http://www.harveynick.com/blog/2010/10/11/youre-speaking-my-language-baby-part-3-c/"/>
    <updated>2010-10-11T12:00:48+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.harveynick.com/blog/2010/10/11/youre-speaking-my-language-baby-part-3-c</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The second language I&#8217;m considering is <strong>C++</strong>. This is the language that I use the most at my day job. It&#8217;s also the language that&#8217;s used to build the vast majority of computer games and one hell of a lot of commercial software. I&#8217;m not as familiar with it as I am with Java, but I know it well enough to be productive with it. I&#8217;m also familiar enough with it to know how horribly <a href="http://yosefk.com/c++fqa/">broken</a> it is in many respects. One of the major design goals of Java (among other more modern programming languages) was to fix the problems with C++. It also has no dynamic capabilities what-so-ever, but it&#8217;s possible to paper over this by using a minimal dynamic runtime such as <a href="http://www.lua.org/">Lua</a> for scripting.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>All things being equal, C++ is the fastest of the three languages. It is also the one you&#8217;re most likely to write bad code in, though, so there&#8217;s a bit of a trade off here.</p>

<p>As I mentioned, most games are programmed using C++. As a result, there is a veritable shit load of graphics engine options. I would probably tend towards using the open source<a href="http://www.ogre3d.org/">Ogre3D</a> rendering engine (or something similar), but it&#8217;s worth baring in mind that I could easily switch to using, say, the Quake 3 engine (open sourced by id) if I wanted to. I could also port the project to using a commercial graphics engine if I had the desire to do such a thing.<br/>
The measure of applicability to other parties is definitely a point in favour of C++. Code written in C++ would be the easiest of the three for deployment as part of a larger project, as that project is most likely to be written in C++. In terms of acting as a developer showcase C++ has the edge as well, as it&#8217;s the language a lot of companies ask for code samples in.</p>

    <id>http://www.harveynick.com/blog/2010/10/10/youre-speaking-my-language-baby-part-2-java</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The first language I&#8217;m considering is <strong>Java</strong>. This is by far the language I&#8217;m most comfortable and proficient with. It was used for about 90% of my Bachelors degree, I wrote the entire codebase of my PhD using it, and it gets used here and there in my day job. I&#8217;m comfortable with Java, and find it to be quite a pleasant language to program in. Big tick on the question regarding my ability to use it, then. Java has some modest dynamic capabilities built in, but it also has a lot of small options for using higher level languages for the scripting, the cleanest of which is possibly Groovy.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Java has a bad reputation performance wise, but this largely isn&#8217;t true any more. It does run using a virtual machine, but is compiled to native code at run time. It&#8217;s a lot easier to write good code using Java than the other languages I&#8217;m considering, and that can help with performance a lot, but in general Java has the potential to be the slowest of the three, all things being equal.</p>

<p>Tools are actually not a problem. There are a lot of high quality graphics engines available for Java, with the <a href="http://www.jmonkeyengine.com/">Java Monkey Engine</a> (JME) being my favourite. A physics add-on is available in the form of <a href="http://code.google.com/p/jmephysics/">JMEPhysics</a>, with the next version slated to have a physics engine baked in. Raw OpenGL is also an option with <a href="http://lwjgl.org/">LWJGL</a>, should I want it. Likewise, I suspect that the <a href="http://www.reddwarfserver.org/">Red Dwarf Server</a> is likely meet my communication needs.</p>

<p>The applicability of Java to other interested parties is an interesting question. A lot of software gets written in Java. A LOT. But the vast majority of it is not games. Largely, I think this is because it&#8217;s perceived to be lacking in the performance department. It&#8217;s also a little harder to protect you code when you&#8217;re writing in Java, too. The previously mentioned JME has the support of a commercial games company, though, so clearly there is interest. Computers are getting faster at quite a rate, so performance has the potential to be less of a concern, especially if the project you&#8217;re working on has the whiff of a server side application about it. When it comes to server side code, I think Java is definitely winning the race. Frankly, I have a bit of trouble calling this one either way.</p>

<p>One language down, two to go. Look for the next post tomorrow, should you be interested in such things.</p>

    <link href="http://www.harveynick.com/blog/2010/10/09/youre-speaking-my-language-baby-part-1-introduction/"/>
    <updated>2010-10-09T12:00:33+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.harveynick.com/blog/2010/10/09/youre-speaking-my-language-baby-part-1-introduction</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you&#8217;re about to start on a programming project of some sort (and I am), then the first choice you have to make is the main programming language you&#8217;re going to use. Now, if you&#8217;re carrying out this project on your employers time they probably have very specific views about that. I&#8217;m not doing this project on company time, though, so the world is my oyster, figuratively speaking. There are, at a rough guess, shit loads of programming languages out there. There&#8217;s a reasonably good list to be found <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_programming_languages">here</a>, though it is missing a couple of the weird ones. While constructing the project using a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LOLCODE">language</a> which uses LOL cat type speech for syntax, or takes its input in the form of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piet_(programming_language)">abstract art</a> would be an excellent mental challenge, I&#8217;m sure, that&#8217;s just not what I&#8217;m looking for.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>I&#8217;m also, right off the bat, going to eliminate a couple of other classes of language. First of all: no functional programming languages. I have no patience for learning a new programming paradigm, expecially one which up until now has shown limited application outside academia. No Haskell, no CAML and absolutely no Prolog.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m also not considering high level dynamically typed languages, so no Python and no Ruby. For that matter, no Groovy or Lua either. You can program very quickly in them, but I&#8217;m not prepared to take the performance hit which comes with them. Python might be very popular, but I think it actively encourages bad programming practice and I want no part of that. It&#8217;s an excellent hobbyest language, but that isn&#8217;t what I&#8217;m looking for.</p>

<p>Lastly: I&#8217;m not looking at anything based on Microsoft&#8217;s .Net platform, and that includes Mono.</p>

<p>The questions I&#8217;m going to be asking of the languages I am considering are the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>How well  can I use it?</li>
<li>Generally, speaking, how good is the performance?</li>
<li>What tools are available? Specifically, does it have access to the libraries I&#8217;ll need to build the project. These are mostly ones relating to 3D graphics, inter-computer (client-server) communication and (possibly) physics. There are probably a couple of other things I haven&#8217;t thought of yet.</li>
<li>How relevant is it to others? That is, if I write the project in this language will it be useful to other interested parties?</li>
</ul>


<p>I considered three languages and I&#8217;ll tackle them one at a time in future posts.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Sooner or later, most people go looking for a bit of escapism every once in a while. There&#8217;s definitely a spectrum of how far people like to escape. Some can&#8217;t stand anything which steps outside the bounds of the possible, others practically require spaceships and dragons to co-exist with emotionally retarded vampires. Likewise, some people look to books for their diversions, some theatre, radio, television or cinema. Some people play computer games or one sort of another. No one is saying that everyone, or indeed anyone, has make a specific and binding choice, though. You can watch a movie about the emotional and theological struggle of gay monks one evening, read a couple of chapters of a book about an adolescent wizard immediately before bed, and take on the role of a greek god laying waste to&#8230; well&#8230; everything the next day.</p>

<p>The point of my new project (Clockwork Aphid), when you get right down to it, has to do with my own frustrations with a certain kind of computer game. Specifically: the ones I&#8217;m going to lump together under the moniker &#8220;virtual worlds&#8221;. There are a lot of them out there, and I can&#8217;t claim to have tried them all, but I have had a play with a couple of the major ones and that&#8217;s what I want to talk about today.</p>

<p><span class='pullquote-right' data-pullquote='the sprawling 500 lb gorilla that actually accounts for almost 10% of the revenues of the US gaming industry'>
Where to start, though? I&#8217;ve gone backwards and forwards about this quite a bit and come to the conclusion that I should probably start at the top. The top in this case being the brute, the sprawling 500 lb gorilla that actually accounts for almost 10% of the revenues of the US gaming industry: World of Warcraft, or WoW, to give it its not exactly modest acronym. What we&#8217;re talking about here is not just a virtual world, but a massively multi-player online role playing game, or MMORPG. Let&#8217;s examine the meaning of this working backwards through the words:<br/>
</span></p>

<ul>
<li>Game - this is something you play, for fun.</li>
<li>Role playing - it contains some component of playing a role different to that of your everyday life. All games do this to a greater or lesser extent, but the difference here is that your <em>character&#8217;s</em> own personality and skills have more relevance to the gameplay than your own.</li>
<li>Online - the game is played over the Internet.</li>
<li>Multi-player - the game is played simultaneously by multiple people.</li>
<li>Massively - the &#8220;multiple people&#8221; playing the game can number in the thousands.</li>
</ul>


<p>WoW is set in an essentially Tolkenesque fantasy world populated by humans, dwarfs and elves, acting more or less as you&#8217;d expect them to had you read or seen the Lord of the Rings. There are other races: Orcs, trolls, undead, gnomes, undead, who are a little more stylised. There&#8217;s quite a bit of steam punk and tribal culture in places. That&#8217;s not the point though. The point, as in any game, is the question &#8220;what does the user do?&#8221; and the answer in this case is:</p>

<p>The user takes on the role of one of a member of one of these races, with a particular profession and proceeds to battle their way through the world, fighting hostile elements and performing quests in order to gain &#8220;experience&#8221; and improve their character. They can also join forces with other players to take on quests; in fact this is practically required in some cases.</p>

<p><span class='pullquote-right' data-pullquote='A lot of the time you just find yourself killing monster, after monster, after monster'>
I&#8217;ve spent a bit of time playing WoW and frankly it can be a lot of fun. The world is HUGE and exploring it can be very enjoyable. There&#8217;s also a genuine sense of achievement to be gained from &#8220;levelling up&#8221; your character. Most of the time. Which brings me to the first frustration: the grind. A lot of the time you just find yourself killing monster, after monster, after monster. This is partly because a large number of the quests (which are handed out by non-player characters, or NPCs, with large yellow exclamation points above their heads) sound like this:<br/>
</span></p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;Oh no! &lt;insert description of peril>! Please help us! Kill &lt;insert number> of &lt;insert name of monster responsible for this peril>&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>Or even worse and with a more concrete example:</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;Please bring me 10 giant spider legs.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>The problem here being that against all conventional logic, you might only get a giant spider leg for every third giant spider you kill. As you may have gathered, they don&#8217;t call it the grind because it&#8217;s fun.</p>

<p><span class='pullquote-right' data-pullquote='You do the townsfolk a good turn by depleting the number of bandits besieging the town, but this changes nothing'>
The next frustration is that you don&#8217;t actually affect the world. You do the townsfolk a good turn by depleting the number of bandits besieging the town, but this changes nothing. Other players come along and do the exact same quest time after time after, because the bandits simply reappear a couple of minutes after you take them down. So, when you do the quest to take out the leader of the bandits, you arrive to find that a queue has formed. The first person kills him, the others wait for him to reappear and do the same. It sort of breaks the illusion of the game. More annoying still: you&#8217;ve been waiting patiently for your turn, but some git comes running in and kills him first. Most annoyingly, to my mind is&#8230; Well&#8230; Let me give you an anecdotal example:<br/>
</span></p>

<p>I was playing as a rogue, which is a nice way of saying thief/assassin, and had been given a quest to recover a particular object from a beach. Needless to say, the beach turned out to be crawling with monsters. So I set about luring them away one by one, depleting their numbers so I could get my trophy without getting my ass handed to me (rogues can give it out, but they cannot take it). The problem being, that by the time I get the to point where I can start thinking about claiming the prize, the monsters I killed first have already started to resappear!</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s the problem: this is not how the game wanted me to go about this task. It wanted me to find a group of other players and storm the beachhead, quickly despatching the monsters and grabbing the prize. I was playing as a damn rouge, though! That is not how an assassin does business! In the end I got lucky. A warrior stormed the beach as I was creeping up, and I snaffled the loot while the monsters were distracted. Amoral? I believe I did point out that I was playing as a rogue.</p>

<p><span class='pullquote-right' data-pullquote='it can make you feel as though you and your actions don&#8217;t really matter'>
In a regular, non MMO, RPG, everything you kill stays dead for the most part. In this case the world doesn&#8217;t have to be persistent (as in unchanging) because you&#8217;re the only one playing it and it doesn&#8217;t matter if no one else can do the quests. In an MMO, almost <em>everyone</em> needs to be able to do the quests, so the world generally performs a decent impression of Kirsten Dunst&#8217;s hair in Interview with a Vampire. It is a workable solution to the problem, but it can make you feel as though you and your actions don&#8217;t really matter, which isn&#8217;t ideal given that you&#8217;re supposed to be a hero.<br/>
</span></p>

<p>I&#8217;m not the first person to have these sort of complaints, or to contemplate solutions, but that&#8217;s a story for another day.</p>

    <id>http://www.harveynick.com/blog/2010/10/07/what-in-the-name-of-all-thats-holy-is-a-clockwork-aphid</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Clockwork Aphid is the name I&#8217;m giving to a side project I&#8217;ve had sitting at the back of head for a little while. I&#8217;m actually going to try and build it now. What it actually is is quite big and hard to explain, so I&#8217;m going to do it gradually, over time. This way I also get to maintain a little bit of mystery. Here&#8217;s what I will say up front, though:</p>

<!-- more -->


<ul>
<li>It&#8217;s a programming project;</li>
<li>It&#8217;s connected to computer games;</li>
<li>It&#8217;s also connected to&#8230; another form of digital entertainment which is (arguably) related to computer games;</li>
<li>In the beginning at least, I&#8217;m going to make the code I write open source.</li>
</ul>


<p>The actual name &#8220;Clockwork Aphid&#8221; comes from the name of the group I helped field to the &#8220;Dare to be Digital&#8221; computer game creation competition several years ago. We didn&#8217;t get in, but we proposed a game called &#8220;Bad Penny&#8221; which I still think was a bloody good idea. Some of the elements of that project are contained in this one also, but the name Bad Penny was chosen for a good reason. It was very appropriate for the type of game we were proposing. This project is potentially bigger, though, and I don&#8217;t want to limit the scope.</p>

<p>As for the Clockwork Aphid name itself? I just plain thought it sounded good then and I still think it sounds good now.</p>

    <id>http://www.harveynick.com/blog/2010/08/24/its-hestontastic</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Strangely, I don&#8217;t think my good lady actually thought I&#8217;d attempt to make any of the actual recipes when she bought me a copy of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heston_Blumenthal">Heston Blumenthal</a>&#8217;s &#8221;<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Further-Adventures-Search-Perfection-Blumenthal/dp/0747594058/ref=pd_bxgy_b_img_b">Further Adventures in Search of Perfection</a>&#8221; for Christmas last year. Sometimes I worry about how little she appears to know me. A chili con carne recipe which takes three days to prepare is exactly the sort of challenge I&#8217;m practically incapable of resisting. A black forest gateau that requires the use of a hoover? I say &#8220;bring it on!&#8221;</p>

<p>I do intend to have a crack at those ones, but I thought I&#8217;d ease my way in with the Bolognese recipe from &#8221;<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Search-Perfection-Heston-Blumenthal/dp/0747584095">In Search of Perfection</a>,&#8221; which takes a mere ten hours to prepare and requires no special tools.</p>

<p>We invited round two friends whom we have cause to thank and don&#8217;t see nearly enough of, and I gave it my best shot. Here&#8217;s the maestro himself, explaining how it&#8217;s done:</p>

<iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/6pR5kVyemdY" width="" height="" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>




<iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/Mj9K6iSmafc" width="" height="" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>




<iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/UMx4HUKaA9k" width="" height="" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


<p>In the interests of honesty, here are the things I did differently:</p>

<ul>
<li>My good lady is allergic to celery, so I took it out;</li>
<li>Every butcher I tried practically laughed in my face when I asked for minced ox tail, so I used good steak mince;</li>
<li>I don&#8217;t hold with serving a meat sauce with spaghetti, so I used pappardelle (thick ribbons);</li>
<li>I also served it with some particularly good garlic bread of my own devising.</li>
</ul>


<p>I should also point that the video is missing a couple of minor steps. If you want to actually make it, I recommend buying the book. If you have no desire to make it whatsoever, I recommend buying the book. Both books. They are fascinating reads. If you can&#8217;t read, I recommend buying the book. It also has good pictures. I&#8217;m a little confused if that&#8217;s the case, though.</p>

<p>At this point you&#8217;re probably wondering if the sauce is good enough to warrant the expenditure of an entire day to make it? In short: yes. Abso-fucking-lutely. It was amazing. Will I make it again? Probably, though certainly not often. I might make it sometime when my good lady isn&#8217;t in town and I can include the celery without the risk of her death (the sauce is not quite that good). Perhaps I&#8217;ll even try begging and pleading with one of the local butchers to get some minced ox tail or a better substitute.</p>

<p>What I will definitely do is use some of the individual techniques. The tomato base may well become a sauce for meatballs, and the caramelized onions will almost certainly get used in a gravy or two.</p>

<p>Across the entire of both books are sixteen recipes. One down.</p>

    <id>http://www.harveynick.com/blog/2010/08/15/musical-arithmetic</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Okay, so here&#8217;s the formula:</p>

<pre><code>(A - B) + C = D
</code></pre>

<p>And here are the variables:</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>A = <iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/UZjf9C6atT4" width="" height="" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p>Evanescence. More specifically: the original line up (as far as most of the world is concerned). I like Evanescence quite a bit, but that&#8217;s about 74.2% Amy Lee&#8217;s voice. The girl has one hell of a pair of lungs on her. I picked this particular song from the first album for reason which may become obvious later. For what it&#8217;s worth, I think Everybody&#8217;s Fool and Imaginary are a much better songs.</p>

<p>B = <iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/bP5wmtOXCQ" width="" height="" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p>Evanescence again? No. Well&#8230; yes, but the current line up. Specifically: Amy Lee herself. I picked this song from the second album (which is much better than the first) because it seems to have the most Amy Lee-ness in it. It doesn&#8217;t have an actual video, though, so alternatively:</p>

<p>B = <iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/Hqd2FJF8-h8" width="" height="" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p>I figure having a deficit of Seether won&#8217;t affect the sum either way, so this works too.</p>

<p>C = <iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/dUyMvaJwACc" width="" height="" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p>Former Irish American Idol contestant* Carly Smithson. Once again: A hell of a pair of lungs. Not an entirely dissimilar look, but quite a different vocal style, it would appear. Carly&#8217;s voice has a bit more blues in it, a bit more sultriness.</p>

<p>D = <iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/zzTZeeMCUBk" width="" height="" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p><a href="http://www.wearethefallen.com/">We are the Fallen</a>, the new band from Ben Moody, two other former members of Evanescence and Carly Smithson. Can you seen why I picked that particular Evanescence song? That&#8217;s more than a passing resemblance, style wise. There is a second reason I picked it, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdYa0oeMLfI&amp;feature=related">however</a>. Carly has a less operatic voice, though, and a bit more range in terms of singing style. I love me some female fronted metal, so I&#8217;ll be keeping an eye on this band.</p>

<p>Okay, here&#8217;s another one which plays a bit better to her frankly spectacular voice:</p>

<p>D = <iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/u24NXTBHLYU" width="" height="" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p>* That is: she&#8217;s Irish and was a contestant on &#8220;American Idol.&#8221; There is no such show as &#8220;Irish American Idol,&#8221; so far as I&#8217;m aware.</p>

    <id>http://www.harveynick.com/blog/2010/08/05/location-location-location</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of the few things I&#8217;ve missed since abandoning the good ship Windows PC for the Mac&#8230; er&#8230; Zeppelin (why not?) is magazines. I used to really enjoy reading the PC gaming and hardware mags. Oftentimes they were pitched at about the right level for me. I felt neither patronised nor confused. I&#8217;m afraid to say that this is not the case with Mac magazines. For the most part they tend to aim a little low, tech wise (no kidding, right?). I did also try Linux magazines, but generally found them to be way too dry and not especially well written. Once again, quelle surprise. Quelle surprise beaucoup.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>So I was, as I&#8217;m sure you can imagine, quite overjoyed to discover <a href="http://www.wired.co.uk/">Wired</a> magazine. A platform agnostic tech magazine pitched about the right level (ish) for me, tech wise, whilst also having some focus on the business side of technology? Win! If you&#8217;re not reading it already, I highly recommend it. So, when Wired decided to give the cover story to location based social networks, concentrating on <a href="http://foursquare.com/">Foursquare</a> and <a href="http://gowalla.com/">Gowalla</a>, I though &#8220;sure, what the hell?&#8221; and gave them both a go.</p>

<p>That was a good couple of weeks ago now, and I can categorically say that I&#8217;m not sure if I like them or not. Nor am I sure which of the two I prefer. The idea, basically, is that you periodically tell them where you are.</p>

<p>Where are you going? Wait, there&#8217;s more.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a game of sorts, you see. Foursquare awards you points for visiting places (more if they&#8217;re new places) while Gowalla gives you badges in your&#8221;passport.&#8221; Both of them also award you bonuses for various things, and Foursquare declares you the &#8220;Mayor&#8221; of locations if you visit them more than anybody else. There is a bit more to it than this, of course, there&#8217;s a social aspect, connected to both locating your friends and finding out where is currently &#8220;happening,&#8221; (this is the correct term, yes?) but I think I&#8217;ve given you the gist.</p>

<p>On balance: foursquare seems to do more in terms of the whole &#8220;life as a game&#8221; idea, and makes it feel more worthwhile to visit places multiple times&#8230; but Gowalla has a MUCH better design, and the badges and pins (achievements) it gives you are much prettier, but lacks the competitiveness of Foursquare. I think, at this point, I would tentatively recommend both, but particularly Foursquare if you&#8217;re a competitive sort. Either way, feel free to friend me if you do give them a try (it&#8217;s free).</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Further to my last post, here&#8217;s a couple more films which caught my eye, though one of them is a ways off yet.</p>

<p>Faster (<a href="http://trailers.apple.com/trailers/independent/faster/">trailer</a>) - I will go and see Dwayne Johnson in any film which doesn&#8217;t involve him wearing a tutu or fairy wings. Perhaps even then, and you can quote me on that. The guy has more charisma and physical presence than just about everyone else out there, and is (as far as I&#8217;m concerned) always good value for money, regardless of the quality of the actual film. Frankly, the guy should be a much bigger start than he is. That he&#8217;s in an indie revenge flick makes me very happy indeed. Also: great trailer.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p></p>

<p>Sucker Punch (<a href="http://trailers.apple.com/trailers/wb/suckerpunch/">trailer</a>) - Zack Snyder is another one of those directors who&#8217;s work I would go sight unseen. Though Watchmen wasn&#8217;t quite the film I wanted it to be, I still enjoyed the hell out of it and I loved his two previous films (300 and Dawn of the Dead). This is a director who makes <em>cinema</em> and every frame of it is absolutely, stunningly beautiful. Evidence so far suggests that he actually works pretty well with actors and knows how to handle a plot, also, which is nice (Micheal Bay, take note). This is his first time working with an original property, so I guess we&#8217;ll have to see how it goes. Oh yeah, it also seems to have nazis, dragons, sword wielding burlesque girls, Zeppelins, spaceships and mini gun toting giant samurai demons&#8230; and something tells me that&#8217;s not the half of it&#8230;</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The Cineworld unlimited card is a wonderful thing, especially given that I no longer have a student card (I am still a student, technically. Don&#8217;t ask). It encourages you to take a much more &#8220;what the hell,&#8221; type attitude to heading to the cinema, and I love me some cinema. That being the case, I thought I&#8217;d write a (probably) quick post covering the films coming out this year that I&#8217;m pretty certain I&#8217;ll be going to see.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>So, in particular order (aside from the one in which they occurred to me):</p>

<p>Inception (<a href="http://trailers.apple.com/trailers/wb/inception/">trailer</a>) - There are some director&#8217;s who pretty much guarente I&#8217;ll go see a film. Christopher Nolan is one of them. Likewise, there are some actor&#8217;s who pretty much guarente I&#8217;ll go and see a film. Ellen Page is one of them. Also: this film look awesome.</p>

<p>The Social Network (<a href="http://movies.yahoo.com/premieres/20889647/standardformat">trailer</a>) - David Fincher is another one of the directors who almost guarantees I&#8217;ll go see a film. Aaron Sorkin is a writer who pretty much guarantees I&#8217;ll go see a film. I didn&#8217;t think I was interested in a film about Facebook, but it turns out that I really, really am. Watch the trailer.</p>

<p>Machete (<a href="http://trailers.apple.com/trailers/fox/machete/">trailer</a>) - I didn&#8217;t think much of Death Proof, but I loved me some Planet Terror, and this looks like it&#8217;s coming from the same headspace.</p>

<p>Tron Legacy (<a href="http://trailers.apple.com/trailers/disney/tronlegacy/">trailer</a>) - I think I might have already mentioned this one.</p>

<p>The Town (<a href="http://trailers.apple.com/trailers/wb/thetown/">trailer</a>) - Ben Affleck might be a genius. Perhaps you didn&#8217;t know that. You might assume that it was Matt Daemon who did most of the heavy lifting when it came to writing Good Will Hunting. But did you go see Gone Baby Gone? Because he wrote (well, adapted) and directed that and it was <em>spectacular</em>. I&#8217;m hoping he&#8217;s done it again.</p>

<p>The Expendables (<a href="http://trailers.apple.com/trailers/lions_gate/theexpendables/">trailer</a>) - A cast made up almost entirely of action legends? Written and directed by the man who brought us Rambo? I&#8217;m there. If you didn&#8217;t watch Rambo (the most recent one), perhaps you should. It is incredibly, unflinchingly violent. But it&#8217;s a film about violence and you might be surprised by how much it has to say.</p>

<p>Scott Pilgrim vs. The World (<a href="http://trailers.apple.com/trailers/universal/scottpilgrimvstheworld/">trailer</a>) - I love it. I love the style. I love the sense of humour. I love the ideas. I&#8217;ll be very surprised I don&#8217;t giggle with glee all the way through this one.<br/>
R.E.D. (<a href="http://trailers.apple.com/trailers/summit/red/">trailer</a>) - I&#8217;m not even going to try explaining this one. Just watch the trailer.</p>

<p>Knight and Day (<a href="http://trailers.apple.com/trailers/fox/knightandday/">trailer</a>) - I don&#8217;t know about you, but I mostly go to the cinema to be entertained. This looks like it will be super entertaining. Side note: I might not like Tom Cruise on a person, but I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever disliked him in a film.</p>

<p>The Green Hornet (<a href="http://trailers.apple.com/trailers/sony_pictures/thegreenhornet/">trailer</a>) - This looks all kinds of silly. These ingredients (superhero + martial arts + star of Knocked Up + director of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind) should not go together. But I bet the first person to eat a peanut butter and jam sandwich said the same thing.</p>

<p>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hollows (<a href="http://trailers.apple.com/trailers/wb/harrypotterandthedeathlyhallows/">trailer</a>) - I expect to be disappointed by this one. I have been by every other one of these films. But that doesn&#8217;t mean I didn&#8217;t enjoy them (except the second one). I&#8217;m looking forward to the conclusion of the first set of adaptations of these books.</p>

<p>There are more, but that&#8217;ll do for now. What do you guys think? Any of these look good? Any look great? Any look awful? Anything you&#8217;re particularly looking forward to?</p>

<p>As a slight aside, I&#8217;m also HarveyNick on Tumblr and Twitter, and I&#8217;m thinking of moving the 15 words or less film review to Tumblr instead of here, as it seems to fit better. Can anyone think of a reason I shouldn&#8217;t (it&#8217;ll still get cross posted to Facebook).</p>

    <id>http://www.harveynick.com/blog/2010/06/19/identity</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As you may or may not know, I&#8217;m currently in Australia. In fact, I&#8217;ve now been here for a little over a month. I&#8217;ll blog about it sooner or later, but not yet. This is largely because I don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m going to say. This trip has been an alarming combination of coolness and frustration so far, and I don&#8217;t want to let too much of the later slip out. That would be highly unprofessional of me, and possibly not great either for my employer or my career.</p>

<p>This post shall be about something else.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>I have a side project that I&#8217;ve chomping at the bit to get started on, and while I&#8217;ve been here I&#8217;ve worked up a couple of fairly good ideas for it. I can&#8217;t start work on it, though, because I only have my work computer with me, and a studiously avoid doing any side projects or personal work on it, just to be on the safe side, intellectual property wise. Aside from reading up on things and doing some scribblings on paper, the other thing I can do is set up a bit of infrastructure.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m going to make the project public, both in terms of open sourcing the code and blogging about the ideas behind it (at least to begin with). But where, though? Here&#8217;s my dilema: I&#8217;m HarveyNick on wordpress, Tumblr, Twitter* and now BitBucket (the place I&#8217;ll be hosting the code - side note: I&#8217;ll be going with Mercurial for revision control). Should I write the blog entries here (and have them trickle down to tumblr and twitter), and host the code directly under HarveyNick&#8217;s account on BitBucket? Let&#8217;s say I name the project after my old band, the repository would be</p>

<pre><code>bitbucket.org/harveynick/hinge  
</code></pre>

<p>Which stamps my ownership on it quite heavily. Likewise, if I put blog entries here: same situation. In some senses that&#8217;s a good thing. Right now, it&#8217;s my project. I might not always want it to be that way, though. Getting other people involved might also be good. I tend to work better (a lot better) when I have someone to bounce ideas off. So let&#8217;s consider option 2; I put the project under another umbrella, and give myself (ie the harveynick identity) access to it. Let&#8217;s say I go with one of the names my old band was thinking of switching to after some assholes in Chicago threatened to sue us. That would put it here:</p>

<pre><code>bitbucket.org/deadcitywalking/hinge  
</code></pre>

<p>I could then start a deadcitywalking.wordpress.com blog to talk about it, and perhaps link the entries here. Should other people start playing in this particular sandpit, then they could perhaps add their own entries to this blog.</p>

<p>You&#8217;re probably not interested in this. I&#8217;m mostly just thinking out loud. But if you have any thoughts, I&#8217;d love to hear them.</p>

<p>* Why do I have all three of these? I&#8217;m not entirely sure yet, other than because they&#8217;re there.</p>

    <updated>2010-03-15T22:30:08+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.harveynick.com/blog/2010/03/15/trailer-trash</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Every once in a while, a film trailer comes along that I can’t seem to stop myself watching repeatedly. I like trailers in general, which is definitely part of the problem, but some of them really grab hold of me. Two good examples of this are the final theatrical trailer for the recent <a href="http://trailers.apple.com/trailers/paramount/startrek/">Star Trek reboot</a>, and one of the trailers for <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9tnZRs4tNE">The Two Towers</a> (the one with the orchestral version of he awesome theme song from Requiem for a Dream, and words cannot express how disappointed I was when that music wasn’t in the actual film).</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>You might be noticing a dramatic music related theme here, but visuals and dialogue are important too. It all has to click together. You’ve heard it said, I’m sure, that part (or even half) of the the pleasure of a present is in the unwrapping. Same thing, right here. Which brings me back to the latest object of desire I’m metaphorically tugging at the ribbon of. It’s the shiny new trailer for <a href="http://trailers.apple.com/trailers/disney/tronlegacy/">Tron Legacy</a>, long awaited sequel to the 1982 cyber cult classic. I have something of a weakness for stories which which turn computer programmers* into heroes anyway (I’m sure you couldn’t possibly imagine why), but everything in this trailer works for me. There <em>was</em> an initial warning sign, to wit: one of the principle protagonists would appear to be the son of the original hero.</p>

<p>Shit. Where have I seen that recently?</p>

<p>But wait&#8230; Maybe he’s <em>not</em> a complete tool of a character, because I absolutely love the delivery of the one line line he really gets in the trailer. Bruce Boxleitner too, returning from the original, but then I already knew he could handle a bit of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Sheridan_(Babylon_5)">gravitas</a>. After a bit of initial set up, the trailer is basically all about the visuals, and what visuals they are. For a start, one of them is a visual of the gorgeous <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olivia_Wilde">Olivia Wilde</a> (13 from House). It all looks very cool and it all makes me very curious indeed. For some reason, I especially love the way the music distorts as the main title is revealed. In case you hadn’t guessed: I’m quiet excited about this one. Let me know what <em>you</em> think.</p>

<p>* Apparently, “software engineer” is the more politically correct term, but screw you, I know what I am. :)</p>

    <id>http://www.harveynick.com/blog/2010/02/07/and-another-couple-of-things</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Something I forgot to mention in my last post was my trying to look at the iPad from a developer&#8217;s perspective. I talked before about a programming side project that I&#8217;ve had bouncing around in my head for a while. Previously, I mentioned that I wasn&#8217;t sure if it was a website, an application, or some combination of the two. Then again I could see some use cases in which a laptop might be a bit cumbersome and a smart phone too small and underpowered. In which case neither the application of the website is entirely satisfactory. I&#8217;m actually now starting to think that the iPad could be the exact right platform for it. Perhaps I should actually start working my way through the Objective-C text book I&#8217;ve had sitting on my shelf for over a year now&#8230;</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>I have another couple of side projects, some programmery and some writery that have me giving the thing a more than slightly critical glance.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s not the point of this post, though. The fact of the matter is that, although it might sometimes seem that way, Apple does not have a monopoly on multi touch user interfaces. If you want to see a particularly impressive example that neither you nor I (nor the governments of some small countries, I suspect) can afford, look no further than the <a href="http://www.perceptivepixel.com/index.html">Perceptive Pixel</a> website. Another cool example showing someone playing with a multi-touch implementation of the Warcraft 3 real time strategy game can be found below:</p>

<iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/KtKkOhMqVhY" width="" height="" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


<p>That&#8217;s the sort of thing Apple <em>should</em> have shown at their event, in my opinion. There&#8217;s also another tablet doing the rounds called the &#8220;Joojoo,&#8221; which is apparently African for &#8220;magic.&#8221; You should be impressed already. I bet you didn&#8217;t think &#8220;African&#8221; was a language, did ya? That was news to me, too. This tablet looks one hell of a lot like the iPad, but is has a 12.1&#8221; multitouch screen and features a flash supporting web browser. It costs about the same as the starting price of the iPad, also. Sounds like a better deal, you say? Unfortunately I just listed its entire feature list. Web browsing is all it does and it doesn&#8217;t seem to have any capability for offline use. It also has a seriously dodgy past and it&#8217;s makers are being sued as a result. What? You want to see it? Oh. Here:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://realvision.ae/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/joojoo.jpg" title="&#34;The JooJoo&#34;" alt="&#34;The JooJoo&#34;"></p>

<p>I think this device is kinda cool, but way too limited. Like the iPad, iPhone, and iPod Touch it features an onscreen soft keyboard&#8230; but now I very good one from what I&#8217;ve seen. There&#8217;s a <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2009/12/08/joojoo-tablet-hands-on-video/">video</a> of the company&#8217;s CEO demonstrating the device and having a bit of trouble working the keyboard. Not a good sign. The hardware looks pretty cool though, the sort of thing a person might be tempted to buy with the intention of hacking. Not me though. I don&#8217;t like having to act as my own tech support when it comes to the hardware and operating system.</p>

<p>Perhaps I&#8217;m done talking about the iPad and it&#8217;s ilk, and I&#8217;ll soon find something else to prattle on about&#8230; or perhaps I&#8217;ll be back soon with a bunch of use cases the think will have to fulfil in order for me to consider buying one, perhaps in the context of these side project I seem to refuse to go into any detail about. Alright, here&#8217;s a clue which might have meaning to about one person reading this: Bad Penny.</p>

    <id>http://www.harveynick.com/blog/2010/02/03/that-ipad-thing</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Originally, right after I got around the watching the keynote presentation which launched the iPad, I was going to write a blog post about how disappointed I was. I thought they&#8217;d screwed the pooch and I, for one, was seriously underwhelmed.</p>

<p>Needless to say, I didn&#8217;t quite get around to writing it. Since then I&#8217;ve read all the criticism by the naysayers and Apple haters, all the gushing praise from the fanatics and all the stuff in between from the more sensible people*. Now, after some reflection, I find myself somewhere in the middle. I flip back and forwards between thoughts of &#8220;that could be awesome,&#8221; and &#8220;that&#8217;s far too much of a compromise.&#8221;</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Ironically, the thing that&#8217;s bringing me around to the idea is the very thing which people seem to be complaining about the most. Specifically: &#8220;It&#8217;s just an iPod Touch with a bigger screen,&#8221; which, in fairness, is exactly what I was thinking. It&#8217;s not a bad thing, though. The iPod Touch (and iPhone) have a <em>spectacular</em> interface. The touch controls work well enough and the device is responsive enough to make you feel is though you&#8217;re interacting with your music or the internet or your emails in a very direct manor. As a matter of fact, the main limitation of the interface is the small size of the screen. Ah hah&#8230;</p>

<p>I think what actually happened is that Apple made a mess of the keynote. Yes, the first person shooter was very pretty, but not really ideal for the interface. A real time strategy game, something like command and conquer, could really sing on this thing. The iWork apps look pretty cool, but a multi-touch version of iMovie or GarageBand could have been seriously impressive. They really didn&#8217;t make me believe that I could comfortably read a book on this thing&#8230; but if they&#8217;d announced text books for the iBooks store and placed an iPad next to the pile of books you usually need each year&#8230; well, then we&#8217;d have been talking. If they&#8217;d have shown how you could search the contents of a text book, spot light style, I might have been sold. Instead they left me to have to think of these things by myself.</p>

<p>I still not 100% certain I know what it&#8217;s for, though. Does it replace my laptop? Does it go alongside my laptop? Would I use on the sofa? Probably. On a short journey? Can&#8217;t see me getting it out on the bus. A long journey? Yes, I think so. Sitting in a coffee shop? Maybe. It would take up less room on the table. Sitting in the park? A tad more risky. But still, I don&#8217;t know. I&#8217;m disinclined to spend £500+ on something which is just a toy. I think I can live without multi-tasking, but there needs to be a better system to allows different apps to work together. What use are great OmniGraffle and Pages apps if I can&#8217;t insert a diagram from the former into the latter?</p>

<p>Bottom line: I&#8217;ll go and have a play with one after they come out. Then we&#8217;ll see.</p>

<p>PS For my parents, though, the damn thing is almost perfect.</p>

<p>* Well&#8230; I say &#8220;all&#8221;&#8230; what I actually mean is &#8220;some.&#8221;</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Daddy Bear&#8217;s porridge is too expensive.</p>

<p>Baby Bear&#8217;s porridge is underpowered.</p>

<p>Mummy Bear&#8217;s porridge is just right&#8230; but has a monitor in it.</p>

<p>Hhhmmm&#8230; perhaps I should explain&#8230;</p>

<p>It&#8217;s reached that time. My computer is starting to show it&#8217;s age. In small ways, mostly. It stalls occasionally, but with gradually increasing frequency. Every now and then it&#8217;s slow down noticeably, and the fans are spending more and more time going full blast. If it actually died on me that would a <em>disaster </em>right now, but I&#8217;m not too worried about that just yet. Even so, I think it&#8217;s time that it had a worthy heir.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>At present I have a first generation black MacBook, but I think I&#8217;m going to go for a desktop for my next system. I like working at a desk, and with a desktop I&#8217;ll get more bang (and screen) for my buck. I&#8217;ll keeps the laptop around for taking to coffee shops and trips (and the times when I really feel I need to work on the sofa), and synchronise my data between machines using the <em>fantastic</em> <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/referrals/NTExMTkzNDQ5/">DropBox</a>. While I&#8217;m on the subject, I can&#8217;t recommend DropBox enough. It seamlessly synchronises your files to and from the web, and works on all operating systems. Even Windows. Also: it&#8217;s free for the first 2GB. If you&#8217;re interesting in DropBox, please go via the link I posted above, we&#8217;ll both get a bonus 250MB of space!</p>

<p>When, or indeed if, my laptop dies, assuming I&#8217;ve had a pay rise and/or won the lottery, I might replace it with something a bit sleeker. By which I mean a MacBook Air. You might be saying: &#8220;Wait a minute, don&#8217;t you have one of the those funky and cheap little netbook things?&#8221; and the answer would be yes, but I don&#8217;t really use it. The simple fact is: you get what you pay for. It&#8217;s way underpowered and the keyboard is a serious pain to use. Don&#8217;t even get me started on the trackpad. I do have a use for it, though, and I might come back to that at a later date.</p>

<p>But what desktop to get? Which brings us about back to where we came in. The question is: which desktop should I get. I&#8217;m getting a Mac, so my options are:</p>

<p>Mac Pro. Ludicrously powerful, and very expensive. Almost certainly more than I need, and a bigger physical footprint than I&#8217;d prefer. Also uses a LOT of power.</p>

<p>iMac. Gorgeous. Just about the exact specification I&#8217;m looking for. Not exactly cheap, but within the budget. Uses a reasonable amount of power. Is about as eco friendly as a machine with this sort of spec can be. Has an absolutely gorgeous built in 27&#8221; (or 21.5&#8221;, but I would probably go for the 27&#8221;) monitor. That last point is both a pro and a con, while it is spectacular monitor which would probably cost about the same amount as a stand alone unit as the iMac itself costs, I&#8217;d ideally like to be able to use the same monitor for my XBox 360. That&#8217;s how I&#8217;ll be playing games, you see. If I got the iMac I&#8217;d either have to put my old, smaller monitor next to it for the XBox, or move the XBox back into the lounge where I tended not to use it, as I felt like I was imposing and I like to sit quite close to the screen when playing.</p>

<p>Mac Mini. Slightly underpowered. You can get decent processor in it, but the graphics card is quite low spec and I have plans to do some quite graphics-ey things. It is quite cheap, though, and I could buy an decent external monitor to go with it (XBox 360 ahoy!)  and still spend less than I would on an iMac. It&#8217;s also very low power. The most eco friendly desktop on the market, in fact. Going flat out it would still be using less power than the iMac would idle (even taking the monitor into account) and uses only 14 Watts when idle. 14!</p>

<p>So those are my options. You might now be thinking &#8220;Fool! Those are not your options! Get a PC! Then you&#8217;ll have hundreds of options! PCs are better anyway! Macs are for idiots who don&#8217;t know how to use a real computer!&#8221; and you would be a little bit right. That would solve <em>this</em> problem. It would also create about a bazilion new problems, though. Like the distinct possibility that I might throw my computer out of the window.</p>

<p>Maybe you use Windows. Maybe you think it&#8217;s just fine. Maybe you find those Mac adverts really annoying (so do I, most of the time) and you&#8217;re fed up of being told that you should &#8220;get a Mac&#8221; by slightly pompous and patronising people. I&#8217;m not going to do that. If Windows works great for you, keep using it. It <em>is</em> shit though. Maybe not on the surface, but as a piece of software engineering it&#8217;s a chrome plated turd, and Microsoft spends most of the their time doing extra chrome plating. That one of the many reasons that I&#8217;ll be sticking with the Macs until something changes drastically&#8230; and I do mean <em>drastically</em>.</p>

<p>In lieu of a nearby Apple Store I think I might go to John Lewis at the weekend and stare at my options. Maybe push a couple of buttons and try and find a way to stress out the graphics chip on the mini. Anyone got any opinions?</p>

    <link href="http://www.harveynick.com/blog/2009/09/20/just-cant-recommend-highly-enough/"/>
    <updated>2009-09-20T18:25:45+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.harveynick.com/blog/2009/09/20/just-cant-recommend-highly-enough</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today I finished &#8220;The Girl Who Played With Fire&#8221;, translated by Reg Keeland from the swedish book of the same name by Stieg Larsson. It&#8217;s the sequel to &#8216;The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo&#8221; (which is called &#8220;Men Who Hate Women&#8221; in the original swedish), and I really can&#8217;t recommend the pair of them highly enough (as you might have guessed from the title of this blog post).</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>I picked the first book up as the combination of the titular character being described as &#8220;an expert computer hacker&#8221; and the synopsis on the back cover put me in mind of Neil Stephenson&#8217;s &#8220;Cryptonomicon&#8221;, not only one of my favourite books but also an outright work of genius, in my opinion. I would describe &#8221;Cryptonomicon&#8221; as recommended reading if you&#8217;re the sort of person who breaths oxygen and walks upright, if you work with computers I&#8217;d say it verges on being <em>required</em> reading. Since Stephenson lost the plot more recently (in my opinion, that is; I didn&#8217;t make it more than half way through &#8220;Quicksilver&#8221; before giving up in pained frustration) there has been a rather large cyber-fiction based hole in my world. &#8220;&#8230;Dragon Tattoo&#8221; seems as though it might be poised to fill it.</p>

<p>In fact it did not. It&#8217;s a different beast all together. A slow burning and wonderful one, written (and translated) with great skill and care. Both books are very powerful reads, laced with a hatred of misogyny and criticism of a system which doesn&#8217;t do nearly enough to prevent it. It&#8217;s also a ripping great yarn of a mystery, full of strong male <em>and</em> female characters. Nominally, the books are the first two parts of a trilogy. In fact Larsson planned ten books and left an unfinished fourth manuscript together with outlines for books five and six when he died. I&#8217;m waiting with bated breath for the release of the third book. I just hope it ties things up reasonably well and so won&#8217;t leave me too curious about the contents of book I&#8217;ll never be able to read.</p>
