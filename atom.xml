    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>&#8230;In Iceland!</p>

<p>I wanted to come here for a long time (this is no secret), and as the result of a highly unsubtle campaign of strategic hint dropping, here I find myself. It&#8217;s not under ideal circumstances, though. I&#8217;m here for work and so I&#8217;ll be spending most of my time working 12 hour days, doing fiddly embedded computer programming and ridding about in boats waiting for robots to do their thing. I&#8217;m also here with my boss (or someone far higher up the chain of command than myself, at least), and though he&#8217;s a really nice guy there&#8217;s always going to be a significant disconnect. He&#8217;s not my first choice(s)* to share this experience with. I&#8217;d rather be here with my friends. My friends are awesome, you see.</p>

<p>A particular subset of my awesome friends, appropriately: the Icelandic ones, have furnished me with a list of things I might like to see, do and eat while I&#8217;m here. It&#8217;s not a challenge on the scale of &#8220;cook every single recipe in a recipe book&#8221;, but it&#8217;s a fun list all the same and one I plan on making an impression on. I&#8217;ve found a guide to Icelandic punctuation online and am even working up to actually asking for some of the foodstuffs on the list, rather than simply writing them down, pointing at them and smiling hopefully. We&#8217;ll see how it goes. Hopefully it won&#8217;t be a repeat of the Turkish &#8220;thank you&#8221; debacle**.</p>

<p>So far I like it here. It&#8217;s pleasantly calm and quiet (except for the boy racers who just went screaming past the office). We went for Italian food last night (not my choice), but I&#8217;m hoping for something a little more geographically appropriate tonight. Perhaps I&#8217;ll try puffin, it&#8217;s always good to try new things. More news as I get it.</p>

<p>It might amuse some of you to know that I&#8217;ve typed this while my boss was out of the room, launching into a long explanation of&#8230; something.</p>

<p>More news as I get it.</p>

<p>* Why is there no legitimate plural for &#8220;first choice&#8221;? That&#8217;s a linguistic deficiency, right there&#8230;</p>

<p>** It&#8217;s about 20 syllables long and never elicited anything more than a blank stare from anyone we said it to.</p>

    <link href="http://harveynick.github.com/blog/2008/08/24/mdl-celtx-on-the-acer-aspire-one/"/>
    <updated>2008-08-24T21:23:58+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://harveynick.github.com/blog/2008/08/24/mdl-celtx-on-the-acer-aspire-one</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So I managed to get the Celtx screenwriting (and general preproduction) software up and running on my shiny new AA1, and in the interests of sharing the knowledge I thought I&#8217;d post how I did it. Please note, this should also work as general recipe for installing any software not available under the package manager in Linpus Light Linux (provided there are no additional dependencies).</p>

<p>First of all you need to download the software from the downloads page of the Celtx website, <a href="http://www.celtx.com/download.html">here</a>. I&#8217;d recomend getting the straight up Linux version in your choice of language (frustratingly there is no option for British English, though). There is an Asus eee specific version, but that just clears up some dependencies and doesn&#8217;t really provide you with anything extra.</p>

<p>First of all you&#8217;ll need a terminal, so hit Alt+F2, type &#8220;terminal&#8221; (without the quotes) and hit enter. A terminal should have popped up. If you&#8217;re a Linux novice, don&#8217;t worry, you should just be able to copy and paste everything from this page.<br/>
Now you need to unpackage the software. I put it in /opt, because it generally seems to be a dumping ground for user installed applications (as far as I can tell). Type these in the terminal one at a time:</p>

<pre><code>cd /opt

sudo tar -xf /home/user/Downloads/Celtx.tar.gz
</code></pre>

<p>Now, if you type &#8220;ls&#8221; you should see a directory named celtx. So far so good. Next you need to add a link so Celtx can be run from the command line, like this:</p>

<pre><code>sudo ln -s /opt/celtx/celtx /usr/bin/celtx
</code></pre>

<p>In theory that&#8217;s all you need to do. Now if you type &#8220;celtx&#8221; on the command line (or after hitting Alt+F2) the program will run. We can make it a lot easier than that, though. Next we need an icon to represent it on the desktop. There are two options here. First of all you could use an existing one. Type this:</p>

<pre><code>sudo thunar /usr/share/pixmaps
</code></pre>

<p>A file manager window should pop up and if you scroll down you&#8217;ll find all the system icons. If you find one you want to use for Celtx: cool, if you don&#8217;t then you&#8217;re other option is to make one. I&#8217;m not going to get into that, but if you want to do it please bare in mind that is has to be a png, it has to be 90px x 90px in size and it has to be placed in that directory. I found on on the web and resized it myself. Assuming you have the icon you want in the downloads directory and it&#8217;s called &#8220;celtx.png&#8221;, you would type this to get it in the right place:</p>

<pre><code>sudo mv /home/user/Downloads/celtx.png /usr/share/pixmaps/celtx.png
</code></pre>

<p>That done we need to create a desktop entry for it. You need to use a text editor for this. I used &#8220;vim&#8221;, so that&#8217;s what the directions here will say. &#8220;vim&#8221; can be pretty hard to use at first, though, so if you&#8217;re not linux minded you might want to find a tutorial on the web, or replace the &#8220;vim&#8221; command with something else (mousepad is one option that might be easier to use and more familiar). We start by (basically) creating the file:</p>

<pre><code>sudo vim /usr/share/applications/Celtx.desktop
</code></pre>

<p>If you&#8217;re using vim, hit &#8220;i&#8221; (the word insert should appear at the bottom) and then paste the following into the file:</p>

<pre><code>[Desktop Entry]
Version=1.0

X-Desktop-File-Install-Version=0.10
Categories=Work;
StartupNotify=true
</code></pre>

<p>Be sure to replace &#8220;Celtx.png&#8221; with whatever the icon you want to use is called. Also, all those language options are possibly not strictly necessary, but I copied most of this from another file and left them in to be on the safe side. Likewise, I could probably have done something a bit more clever with the &#8220;MimeType&#8221; bit, but decided not to bother. Next, save and exit the file. In &#8220;vim&#8221;, you hit escape, then type:</p>

<pre><code>:wq
</code></pre>

<p>and hit enter. Lastly, we just need to tell Linpus to display Celtx on the desktop:</p>

<pre><code>vim /home/user/.config/xfce4/desktop/group-app.xml
</code></pre>

<p>You should now be looking at an XML file. You need to find this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;id&gt;6&lt;/id&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And insert this underneath it:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;app sequence="2"&gt;/usr/share/applications/Celtx.desktop&lt;/app&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Be sure to increase the &#8220;sequence&#8221; numbers on the other &#8221;<app>&#8221; entries as well, to make sure there are no duplicates.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s about all there is to it. If you reboot the machine you should now find that you have an icon for Celtx on the desktop. After you put some .celtx files on the machine, you might want to right click on one and select &#8220;properties&#8221;, then tell Limpus to open the file type with Celtx (otherwise it&#8217;ll just treat it like a zip file).</p>

<p>This is quite a long post and I have work to do, but I might return in the next couple of days with some things to say about Celtx itself. Happy hunting!<br/>
PS Thanks to the users of the forums on aspireoneuser.com for the knowledge which was needed to work this out.</p>

    <id>http://harveynick.github.com/blog/2008/08/18/my-digital-life-ill-see-your-eee-and-raise-you-one</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My good friend Dougal got himself an Asus eee pc (relatively) recently. He likes it a lot. I like the idea of it, but not so much the implementation. On his version at least, the screen is too small for me, and the later versions are a bit too pricey. I love the idea of a small, light and eminently carriable laptop though. It&#8217;s the premise I originally bought my MacBook under, but I found even that machine to be too bulky and heavy to carry around constantly. The MacBook Air might work, but it&#8217;s very expensive (from the direction I&#8217;m looking at it from, anyway) and not really something I&#8217;d be prepared to pull out of my bag and start working on while sitting on the Meadows.</p>

<p>So I bought myself an Acer Aspire One. I like it quite a bit. I was worried about the size of the keyboard, but it&#8217;s fine; I&#8217;m typing this on it right now. The fact that I don&#8217;t (deliberately) touch type is probably an advantage in this case. I comes with 8 GB of SSD (hard drive, basically) which doesn&#8217;t sound like a lot these days, but I&#8217;ve already bought an extension to this (just waiting for it to arrive). The RAM is also a little low, so I&#8217;m thinking of upgrading that. It&#8217;s not expensive at all, but it is very fiddly, so I guess we&#8217;ll see. I don&#8217;t like laptop touchpads in general, and the one on the one is particularly lame, so I have a two part plan to help with this. The first part is software based and I&#8217;ll come to that later. The second though is yet another fiddly hardware upgrade (how exciting!), namely the installation of a touchscreen. Battery life isn&#8217;t great, so I might get a spare, or an external backup.</p>

<p>The next concern is software. This machine is basically intended to be a glorified word processor, so most of what I want it to run is writing software. Writing in this case means:</p>

<ul>
<li>Blogging (like this)</li>
<li>Work (Thesis, papers etc)</li>
<li>Screen Writing (be nice to get back into this)</li>
<li>General Purpose Writing (of course)</li>
</ul>


<p>and also:</p>

<ul>
<li>Keyboard Control</li>
<li>Synchronisation with my real computer</li>
</ul>


<p>The first obstacle here is the operating system. It currently runs Limpus Light Linux, which I recently heard referred to as “Linux for Pussies”. Unfortunate turn of phrase aside, this description isn&#8217;t too far off the mark. It&#8217;s very simple, very easy too use and boots in about ten seconds. But it&#8217;s also not as easy to customise. It seems that it is possible to install OSX on the One (always my first choice of operating system these days), but due to the lack of Apple hardware it would be crippled to some extent. Even so, it would make finding the other software I need a lot easier, because Open Source and Graphical User Interfaces DO NOT MIX. It&#8217;s one of those instances where to get what you pay for. Open source command line applications are almost uniformly fantastic, but anything with a GUI will probably look like the developer just shat on the floor when asked and then got his dog to do it while he cleaned up the mess. The two serious open source advocates I know both confess to a dislike of doing anything graphical, so maybe it&#8217;s symptomatic. I dunno.</p>

<p>There are exceptions, of course. Eclipse is one, to a lesser extent so is Firefox. Also an exception is the currently gestating Netbook Remix of Ubuntu Linux, which might just be exactly what the doctor ordered, operating system wise. As far as I can tell it&#8217;s not quite ready for public consumption yet, though. As soon as it is I&#8217;ll probably switch, but for the time being I&#8217;ll hack away at the Limpus until I get something workable.<br/>
I&#8217;ll probably use Open Office (with actually runs quite quickly on this machine) for most of the writing, with Celtx (surprisingly good and free) for the screen writing and maybe Kyle for Latex formatting.</p>

<p>Gnome Do should take care of the keyboard control. It&#8217;s a clone of Quicksilver on OSX which works pretty well. It&#8217;ll never work <em>as</em> well, since the architecture of OSX supports this sort of thing better, but it comes close enough. For the synchronisation I&#8217;ll try and set up a custom rsync script to move things back and forward between this machine and my Mac, and then I&#8217;ll do most of the heavy formatting and posting and such from there when possible.<br/>
Speaking of which&#8230;</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>On Friday night I went to the Silent Disco and danced away until 4 am. On the whole I think it was excellent. I think it (or some progression of it) might well be the future of night clubs. It was £10 entry, which might seem a little expensive, but is really no more than the entry to a lot of clubs in Edinburgh. The music was also quite mainstream, and not the hardcore dance I was expecting, which is good because I think his sort of thing is a lot more fun when you can shout along with the words. Especially when you can take of your headphones and watch everyone dancing away without there being any apparent music.</p>

<p>Then on Saturday I drove through to Dunbar with Helen and Dougal to attend a ceilidh for our friend Matt&#8217;s sister, who is leaving the country. What the hell was I doing there? I was invited mostly for my Y chromosome, since it was thought there would be a near overwhelming majority of female types present. This never in fact materialised, leaving me feeling that I was massively intruding (situations like this bring out the English in me to an alarming extent&#8230; I feel as though I can&#8217;t say &#8220;please&#8221;, &#8220;thank you&#8221; and of course &#8220;sorry&#8221; nearly enough). I had a really good time though, and enjoyed the dancing a lot&#8230; even though it&#8217;s the only ceilidh I have clear memories of participating in. Luckily I had a good impromptu dance teacher and I don&#8217;t think I embarrassed myself <em>too</em> much.</p>

<p>I stayed in Dunbar at Helen&#8217;s parent&#8217;s house on Saturday night and then went for long (well&#8230; more mid length) walk around the town the next morning, after a truly fantastic breakfast. Then I was invited to have lunch with Dougal and his parents, which was very pleasant. Still don&#8217;t feel I said those three magical phrases enough at any of those places, but all in all it made for a most enjoyable weekend.</p>

<p>Yesterday, though, I woke up and could barely walk. I seem to have strained both my calves, which really isn&#8217;t ideal. I suspect that I over used them during the weekend and know the muscles are trying to build themselves up. I have hyper-tense muscles in my legs (I think that&#8217;s the phrase the physio used), which on the one hand sometimes means that they resemble steel cables (which is nice), but I can&#8217;t even come close to touching my toes with my legs straight. I suspect this is a participating factor.</p>

<p>Ouch.</p>

<p>As a result of this I&#8217;ve been doing some work from home, as I suspect driving isn&#8217;t such a great idea just now. I could catch the bus in to the University&#8230; but&#8230; well&#8230; I just don&#8217;t want to. Writing up ahoy!</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s a bit more Swedish music for you, this time of a much more melodic nature:</p>

<p>[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saTz3vNW3UQ]</p>

<p>Nevertheless, this is the same singer who appears on &#8220;Dead End&#8221; by In Flames, which is from the exact opposite end of the musical spectrum.</p>

    <id>http://harveynick.github.com/blog/2008/08/05/eclecticism</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Seems the Facebook app does not do what it&#8217;s supposed to. Never mind, I shall content myself with the (better) Wordpress interface. Maybe I&#8217;ll look into writing a Facebook app which interfaces with my RSS feed. That would be cool.</p>

<p>I thought I would write a music related post, since I found a couple of things on YouTube which piqued my interest. First an entirely serious one:</p>

<p>[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIhJC2-UNZA]</p>

<p>When I first heard this on the radio I thought it sounded so fresh they must be a new band. But no, they&#8217;ve been around quite a while, I even knew other songs by them. Unfortunately I don&#8217;t like many of them, but you can&#8217;t have everything. Apparently.</p>

<p>Next, something quite different. Helen played me this at a dinner party on Saturday night for the comedy value. I went looking for it on YouTube, mostly out of curiosity regarding the identity of the female singer, and found a live version. Promise me you&#8217;ll listen to at least some of it, and not just hit stop as soon as the guitars start. It might make you smile.</p>

<p>[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAR4ieUrxUM]</p>

<p>I think I genuinely like this. It helps that I actually like ABBA. I think they wrote really good songs. I also love cross genre covers, and this is definitely that. The female singer&#8217;s voice really works for me as well. I had a look for some of their other stuff, but it&#8217;s really not good, not good at all. It seems they split and formed two entirely new bands, both of which are a slight improvement, though.</p>

<p>Told you I had eclectic taste. Here are a couple more for your edification:</p>

<p>[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyZqpRxnHWg]</p>

<p>A soft one to start off with. Dido is so much better live. In my opinion her voice is perfect, but sounds overly processed on her recordings.</p>

<p>[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgrMfRYCRgw]</p>

<p>Bit of a heavier one, there. This is about as heavy as my taste in music gets. I love the singer&#8217;s voice, though. If you&#8217;re confused by this wait for the chorus. If you don&#8217;t have the pertinence for that, try this one by the same band:</p>

<p>[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAfRW_RMK4M]</p>

<p>See? The band, if you&#8217;re interested, are called &#8220;In Flames&#8221;. Look up a song called &#8220;Dead End&#8221; if you want to know what happens when a Swedish metal (death metal? pop metal? disco metal? death pop disco metal?) band collaborates with a Swedish pop singer song writer&#8230;</p>

<p>How about another soft one? Okay, but I&#8217;m going to get it from an unexpected place:</p>

<p>[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Waw61eE9FyY]</p>

<p>Yes, that was Slipknot. Bet you didn&#8217;t see that coming.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll skew a bit heavier again, but not too far.</p>

<p>[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiHBiRRB1Mw]</p>

<p>I&#8217;m a little disappointed that YouTube couldn&#8217;t supply &#8220;Father&#8217;s Daughter&#8221; from &#8220;Like a Bolt of Lightning&#8221;, but this will do.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m tempted to throw in a bit of Massive Attack, a bit of Evanescence, a bit of Killswitch Engage&#8230; but this post really could go on for ever, so I&#8217;ll stop it here.</p>

    <id>http://harveynick.github.com/blog/2008/08/03/starting-again-again</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Blogging.</p>

<p>By my count I&#8217;ve had three previous attempts (on different services), none of which has entirely worked out. The problems which cause this to be are multiple, but two in particular tend to stand out. Firstly, I tend to write long rambling posts which take a lot of effort, and secondly I tend to not believe that anyone is actually reading them.</p>

<p>So I&#8217;ve come up with the two pronged strategy to try and solve this. First of all, I&#8217;m going to try and make it easier for me to blog. Thus, I&#8217;m switching to WordPress. Why does this make things easier? Well, it means that I can use their software to blog from my iPhone (which will theoretically also lead to shorter posts) and I can also use the web interface.</p>

<p>Thus I can blog from (literally) anywhere, where as before I could only do it from my home computer, as I was using iWeb. I still think iWeb is an awesome program, but I was using a small portion of it&#8217;s functionality, and thus a more bespoke solution becomes a better idea.</p>

<p>Secondly, I&#8217;m going to try and advertise it a bit better. So the particular web interface I&#8217;m using is the WordPress facebook application, which should drop a thingy into my friends&#8217; feeds when I write a new post. Maybe some will read it. Hopefully not too many will find it massively annoying. I like this synergy, it&#8217;s certainly not something I could accomplish using iWeb.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m going to transfer over my previous film reviews, but stripped down without the header and the footer, and make this blog a bit prettier over the next couple of days. I&#8217;m also going to finish the my digital life post I start an age ago, so come back, ya&#8217; hear?</p>
