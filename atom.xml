    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>While <a href="http://badassdigest.com/2013/01/09/film-crit-hulk-smash-hulk-vs.-tom-hooper-and-art-of-cinematic-affectation/">Film Critic Hulk&#8217;s argument</a> generally seems quite well reasoned, I find it a little difficult to stomach someone attempting to lecture me on the theory behind the form of anything in ALL CAPS, and at such length. Also, he makes the unforgivable (in my opinion) mistake of representing his opinion as fact. He states the film falls flat, not that he <strong>believes</strong> it falls flat. No one, apparently, thought to mention this to the legions of people who rated Les Mis so highly on IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes.</p>

<p>At the end of the day in film, just like any other art form, theory is merely a tool. It doesn&#8217;t really matter. Emotional response is what actually matters. Banging on about theory in situations like this just makes you look like someone standing on the deck of the Titanic, harping on to anyone who&#8217;ll listen about how the ship is unsinkable.</p>

<p>I quite like the visual presentation of the film, as did almost everyone else I spoke to about it. When I brought the matter of how it was shot, and how this flies in the face of film theory, they usually laughed and replied: &#8220;So?&#8221;</p>

<p>Also: yes. I&#8217;m back. I hope.</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[Wandering Around London]]></title>
    <link href="http://www.harveynick.com/blog/2012/05/17/wandering-around-london/"/>
    <updated>2012-05-17T21:57:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.harveynick.com/blog/2012/05/17/wandering-around-london</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Apologies, once again, for the radio silence. Over the past couple of months there have been some complications in my private life, and a remarkable amount of my attention has been taken up with figuring out where exactly I&#8217;m going to be living after my current lease runs out (more on that later, perhaps).</p>

<p>Be that as it may, after almost a year, I did find some time to go wandering around the city I now call home. Whilst I took every opportunity to make a brisk constitutional around Edinburgh, I&#8217;d never managed to really do this in London. Part of the reason, I think, is while that you can essentially wander across central Edinburgh in an hour or two, this is really not the case in London. Nipping across town via public transport can take <em>hours</em>.</p>

<p>Recently, though, two excellent excuses presented themselves. Firstly, my father came to visit for a few days and professed an interest to go take a good look at <a href="http://www.kew.org/">Kew Gardens</a>, the Japanese themed portion in particular.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>First stop was the <a href="http://www.kew.org/visit-kew-gardens/garden-attractions-A-Z/Pagoda.htm">Pagoda</a>:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://www.harveynick.com/images/blog/2012/05/13/IMG_0402.jpg"></p>

<p>This is a fairly impressive and imposing building, at least from a distance. Close up it&#8217;s curiously less so. I think it&#8217;s the red brick construction which does it. I&#8217;ve never visited Japan, but this seems a slightly inappropriate building material to me. My father, who has, concurred.</p>

<p>Next was the <a href="http://www.kew.org/visit-kew-gardens/garden-attractions-A-Z/japanese-gateway.htm">Japanese Gateway</a> which, in conjunction with the weather, gave me an excellent opportunity to try out the HDR mode on my phone&#8217;s camera. Here it is without the benefit of HDR:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://www.harveynick.com/images/blog/2012/05/17/IMG_0408.jpg"></p>

<p>…and here it is with the HDR turned on:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://www.harveynick.com/images/blog/2012/05/13/IMG_0409.jpg"></p>

<p>I&#8217;ll be listing that featuring under &#8220;worthwhile&#8221; from here on out. At this point it&#8217;s probably worth confirming a slightly frustrating fact which I suspect is now true of many people: the camera on my phone has completely killed any use of my point and shoot camera. It&#8217;s extremely convenient (being as I <em>always</em> have it with me) and, since my last upgrade, actually very capable. The only thing it lacks is zoom, which is a trade off I&#8217;m willing to make. If I plan on going on a serious photo taking excursion at any point in the future I may bite the bullet and pick up a decent digital SLR. The point and shoot just feels like a weird middle gear at this point.</p>

<p>Back to Kew Gardens, though. Tucked off to one side and not especially well advertised is the Bonsai house. It&#8217;s small, but quite cool, and something my dad specifically wanted to see (Bonsai being a hobby of his).</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://www.harveynick.com/images/blog/2012/05/13/IMG_0448.jpg"></p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://www.harveynick.com/images/blog/2012/05/13/IMG_0450.jpg"></p>

<p>Next, we moved away from the specifically Asian attractions and took a look in the <a href="http://www.kew.org/visit-kew-gardens/garden-attractions-A-Z/Palm-House.htm">Palm House</a>. This really is an impressive building, if uncomfortably hot and humid. Be ready to sweat, all ye who enter here. Besides the tropical plants (which I don&#8217;t seem to have taken any pictures of), the green house itself has an impressive art deco* construction:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://www.harveynick.com/images/blog/2012/05/13/IMG_0451.jpg"></p>

<p>Shortly after this, we took the train from Richmond back to my flat, and I had the fun of explaining to my father the difference between underground and overground trains this far out of the centre (&#8220;you can tell that&#8217;s an underground train because it says &#8216;underground&#8217; on it…&#8221;).</p>

<p>A week or two later, I professed a desire to go see <a href="http://ohsohumbleopinion.tumblr.com/post/19950925968/john-carter">John Carter</a> to friend who suggested we see it in Canary Wharf, allowing us to go wandering around the area beforehand. So we did.</p>

<p>Canary Wharf is one of the parts of London containing buildings which can legitimately be called skyscrapers (I think). I believe it&#8217;s also London&#8217;s financial district. Surprisingly, I actually find it a very pleasant place to be. The taller buildings make you feel as though you&#8217;re walking through canyons, and the area is very clean, though not to the point of feeling antiseptic.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://www.harveynick.com/images/blog/2012/05/13/IMG_0463.jpg"></p>

<p>At the weekend it&#8217;s extremely quiet without quite feeling like a ghost town and there are a surprising amount of things to find. These include a large underground mall, some very cool riverside buildings:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://www.harveynick.com/images/blog/2012/05/17/IMG_0460.jpg"></p>

<p>…and one or two very cool statue / landmark type things:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://www.harveynick.com/images/blog/2012/05/13/IMG_0456.jpg"><!-- header_img /images/blog/2012/05/13/IMG_0456.jpg --></p>

<p>Interestingly, the whole area is also private property, so you might have submit to a vehicle search on the way in. Be that as may, I can recommend it as a reasonable place to wander around at the weekend.</p>

<p>Until next time&#8230;</p>

<p>* This is art deco, right?</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Fair warning: this is going to be a bit of a programming heavy blog post. It&#8217;s also going to be quite Mac specific.</em></p>

<p>One of the things I wanted to change about the format of this blog was to make it more visual, specifically with pictures. This first part of this was to add pictures to the front page. There were a couple of options for doing so. I could just scan through an article, look for the first image tag and use this. Alternatively I could add a mechanism which allowed me to choose the image, in a similar manner to the way <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a> allows me to choose the except which appears on the front page. I decided to go with option two.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>The first part of this was to modify the image tag plug-in like so:</p>

<p>This adds an <code>html</code> comment containing the image path to the page when I use <code>header_img</code> as a <a href="https://github.com/Shopify/liquid/wiki">Liquid</a> tag name rather than the original <code>img</code>. Next I need to do something with this comment. I created an additional Liquid filter which pulls the path out and replaces it with an actual image embed:</p>

<p>Next I modified my theme to run this filter over the page contents just before the one which creates the except on the front page. I&#8217;ll leave this as an exercise for the reader. Lastly, I needed to account for the fact that the created image could be just about any size, while I want some uniformity on the front page. Those of you playing at home will have noticed I assigned <code>header</code> as the class of the image. This allows me to control the appearance of the front page images by adding the following to the <code>sass</code> files in my theme (which are used to generate the <code>css</code>):</p>

<p>Presto. Front page images.</p>

<p>Next, I wanted to try and make it easier to include pictures which I myself have taken with an actual camera (or, more likely, my phone). There really isn&#8217;t any problem when you&#8217;re linking to images elsewhere on the internet, but things can get a bit stickier when you want to include your own images on an Octopress blog. One option is to use a hosted service, like Flickr or PhotoBucket, but this only works when you have an internet connection. I really love that Octopress allows me to work on my site while offline, and I didn&#8217;t want to lose this advantage when I&#8217;m posting pictures. Thus, I decided to just stick the images in my blog&#8217;s images folder.</p>

<p>iPhoto is pretty great for organising and sharing photos (with supported services), but definitely doesn&#8217;t make your life easy if you want to actually get at the image files themselves. That&#8217;s the first problem. The second is that I also want to resize them to something reasonable for my blog. Lastly I want this to be low hassle. I came to the conclusion that an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AppleScript">Applescript</a> is what was required, and this is what I came up with:</p>

<p>Now, Applescript the programming language is completely mental and can be a complete pain in the arse to get right, but Applescript the mechanism is spectacularly powerful. You can do some serious automation with it. This script grabs the path to the currently selected photograph in iPhoto, resizes it and copies it to a folder inside my blog, generated using today&#8217;s date to avoid duplication. Lastly, it places the location of the image on the clipboard, in the form it&#8217;s needed.</p>

<p>To use it, I enabled the scripts menu (it&#8217;s an option in the Applescript editor) and copied the script to the iPhoto scripts folder, which will be something like <code>/Users/&lt;user&gt;/Library/Scripts/Applications/iPhoto</code>. This might be hidden by default, but you can find it via the scripts menu while in iPhoto.</p>

<p>Then, all that is required is to select a photo, trigger the script, and then hit cmd-c in the post I&#8217;m writing. Bingo!</p>

<p>After getting this working, I remembered an <a href="http://arstechnica.com/apple/guides/2011/09/tutorial-os-x-automation-with-macruby-and-the-scripting-bridge.ars/2">ArsTecnica article</a> about using <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a> in place of Applescript for this purpose, so I converted the script to Ruby as an exercise. This is what I came up with:</p>

<p>Ruby is a much more sensible language, and this, to me, is a lot easier to follow. I&#8217;m fairly new to Ruby, so this might not actually be the most Ruby-ish way of doing it, mind. It should be noted that it will only work with <a href="http://www.macruby.org/">MacRuby</a>, though. You will also need <a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php">ImageMagick</a> installed. I made this executable with a quick <code>chmod +x</code> and moved it to the iPhoto scripts folder as well, where it seems to work just fine. So now I have two options. Hopefully, someone out there finds this useful.</p>

<p>Finally, to prove it works, and because it feels a little strange to not actually have any pictures in this entry: here&#8217;s a nice shot taken at Kew Gardens (which hopefully I&#8217;ll talk about more later):</p>

    <id>http://www.harveynick.com/blog/2012/03/27/origin</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of the fun things about working for Google is that from time to time interesting people come into the office to give talks. We had Richard Dawkins a few weeks ago, who gave an interesting if… uncompromising talk. Yesterday we had one of the founders of the <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a> foundation. For those or you who aren&#8217;t aware, the Raspberry Pi is an extremely small (exactly credit card sized) and cheap ($25), yet very capable computing platform. The foundation is the charity formed to produce this hardware.</p>

<p>Why is a charity building computer hardware? Because there is a need for it, caused by a problem you&#8217;re possibly not even aware of. Let me explain; for I am part of the problem. These days when I play computer games it&#8217;s usually on my X-Box or iPhone. They make my life very easy in this regard, since I never have to worry about whether a game will actually run or not. It just works. They are essentially closed systems, though. There is a reasonably high barrier to entry if I actually want to start playing with them as a developer. Specifically: I can&#8217;t do it on the device itself. Furthermore, the very simplicity of the device works against me in this regard, because very little action on my part is required to make it work.</p>

<p>It was not always this way. Let me tell you a story.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>When I was 9 years old (I think), my parents bought me a <em>Sinclair ZX Spectrum +2A</em> computer. It&#8217;s highly likely those words mean nothing to you. It looked like this:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6a/Spectrum_128-2.png/800px-Spectrum_128-2.png"><!-- header_img http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6a/Spectrum_128-2.png/800px-Spectrum_128-2.png --></p>

<p>Truly, it was a wondrous machine, with its 128kB of memory and complete lack of long term storage, and I was utterly thrilled with it. I&#8217;m a nerd. Of course I was. They also bought me a joystick, and a copy of <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</em>. To load this game, you placed the tape (yes, as in audio cassette) into the drive and hit play, having selected the right option from the machine&#8217;s opening menu. You then wandered off for a while to let the machine screech and whine away to itself while it loaded the game. Partly for this reason I quickly tired of the game. I got others eventually, but I was a curious and easily bored child, so I started to read the manual which came with the system.</p>

<p>The vast majority of this was actually a guide to programming in the version of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC">BASIC</a> (Beginners&#8217; All Purpose Symbolic Instruction Code) supported by the <em>+2A</em>. I read it, and I started to tinker. The <em>Sinclair</em> gave you essentially three options after booting:</p>

<ol>
<li>Loading a program from tape;</li>
<li>Program in +2A mode;</li>
<li>Program in 48k mode.</li>
</ol>


<p>The first two are fairly straight forward, but the third was a bit of an odd beast. It emulated the older <em>ZX Spectrum 48k</em>, which looked like this:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/33/ZXSpectrum48k.jpg/800px-ZXSpectrum48k.jpg"></p>

<p>You might notice that there seems to be an awful lot of extra writing on those keys. This is because each key had one or more BASIC keywords bound to it. In 48k mode you couldn&#8217;t just type your program, you have to press the right key for the keyword you were looking for. This could be fast, or it could be <em>slow</em>. Especially if your keyboard lacked this extra data.</p>

<p>The <em>Spectrum</em> also had one or two other interesting quirks. For example, take a look at this screen shot from the classic <em>Treasure Island Dizzy</em>:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/44/Treasure_Island_Dizzy.png"></p>

<p>For a start, this screen shot is showing fully more than half of the colours the <em>Sinclair</em> was capable of producing. Secondly, you might notice that there&#8217;s something slightly odd about the distribution of these colours. Specifically: each block of 8x8 pixels contains at most two, because this was the maximum allowed. Given the limitations of the system, you had to be quite creative if you wanted to produce something worthwhile. Nevertheless, it happened. Not not me, though, because I did very little more than tinker with it.</p>

<p>It did give me a feel for programming, such that I knew more or less what was expected of me when I arrived at Edinburgh University to study Computer Science, though. A course which did it&#8217;s level best to beat every last scrap BASIC out of me, because BASIC, quite frankly, is a horrible language. It was a reasonable place to start, though, and it was how I started out, so I guess it wasn&#8217;t all bad.</p>

<p>Today&#8217;s computers are clearly a lot easier to use than the <em>Spectrum</em> ever was. For the general consumer, this is a very good thing (in my opinion), because you should not need to be a software engineer to operate one any more than you should need to be a mechanic to operate a car. I don&#8217;t own any general purpose computers which aren&#8217;t made by Apple. As a result (I would say), operating my computer requires an extremely low amount of hassle. I don&#8217;t need to know how it works. If I did want to do some programming, in the simplest possible case, I could follow these steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>Push &lt;CMD> + &lt;Space></li>
<li>Type &#8220;Terminal&lt;Enter>&#8221;</li>
<li>Wait a moment for the terminal to load</li>
<li>Type &#8220;python&lt;Enter>&#8221;</li>
</ol>


<p>I can now start fiddling with the <a href="http://python.org">Python</a> programming language, which is a much better place to start than BASIC every was. A more likely scenario is that I might have to load a couple of other programs to help me, such as a good programmer&#8217;s text editor. The point here is that I would have to know how to get my computer in this state in the first place, though. It&#8217;s not front and centre as soon as I turn it on. The <em>Spectrum</em> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affordance">afforded</a> programming in ways that modern computers don&#8217;t. As a result, a curious youngster is much less likely to start tinkering with their computer than they might have been *cough* 21 years ago *cough*.</p>

<p>Modern computers are very much not toys, at least not in the way a bucket of Lego bricks is. They are expensive pieces of equipment. You don&#8217;t don&#8217;t want kids carrying them backwards and forwards from school. Which is where the Raspberry Pi comes in. It is designed to be played with, and cheap enough that if play gets rough and the system breaks it&#8217;s not actually that much of a big deal. It might be quite important for the economy of the UK (and perhaps your country too) that children start playing with computers again. Playing the way you can play with Lego, not the way you play with Action Man. Building things; breaking them; building them again: better.</p>

    <id>http://www.harveynick.com/blog/2012/03/17/new-ish-year-new-ish-blog</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>2011 was an interesting year for me. A lot changed. I turned 30. After 10 years of residency I moved away from Edinburgh, a city I love dearly, and took a job in London. With <a href="http://www.harveynick.com/blog/tags/google">Google</a>. As a result, I no longer work with <a href="http://www.harveynick.com/blog/tags/autonomous-underwater-vehicles">Autonomous Underwater Vehicles</a> for a living. Instead I build web services. Quite the change, I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll agree. In the early months of the year I finally completed the corrections to my <a href="http://www.harveynick.com/blog/tags/phd">PhD</a>, and then in the summer: I graduated. It took 6 years (all together) but I am now Dr. Nick Johnson. I also <a href="http://www.harveynick.com/blog/2011/07/18/the-sound-of-one-hand-clapping/">lost my grandmother</a>, a fact which still brings me to tears on occasion.</p>

<p>In this light, the fact that I decided, towards the end of the year, to shift my blog away from <a href="http://wordpress.org">Wordpress</a> and over to its own domain barely even casts a shadow. I did, though, and as a result you&#8217;re now reading these words on a site built using <a href="http://octopress.org">Octopress</a>, which is hosted at harveynick.com. As you may have noticed, all of the old posts from my <a href="http://harveynick.wordpress.com">wordpress site</a> have been ported over, minus the short film reviews, which you&#8217;ll find <a href="http://ohsohumbleopinion.tumblr.com">here</a>. I&#8217;m not going to go into how I accomplished this, except to say: I did it the same way <a href="http://mattgemmell.com/2011/09/12/blogging-with-octopress/">Matt Gemmel did</a>.</p>

<p><span class='pullquote-right' data-pullquote='It&#8217;s not finished, but it will serve well enough for me to try and start producing actual content again'>
For the most part, this site is stock Octopress. I&#8217;ve played with the fonts, made the heading and background static and added a little more infrastructure (index pages for tags, embed scripts for YouTube and Vimeo videos and a couple of other bits). It&#8217;s not finished, but it will serve well enough for me to try and start producing actual content again. I do want to make it a bit more visual, particularly the front page, and somehow integrate other content I produce into it. I also want to make it work a little better on mobile browsers and, lastly, make it a little bit more my own. The colours will change, and I&#8217;ll try to find a background which doesn&#8217;t require such a large file and isn&#8217;t so closely associated with Apple.
</span></p>

<p>What will I be writing about though? Well:</p>

<p>I plan to have <a href="http://www.harveynick.com/blog/tags/clockwork-aphid">Clockwork Aphid</a> actually doing something of use this year. I&#8217;m going to enhance the current Java version up to a point where it can generate interesting landscapes efficiently and in a parallel fashion. I&#8217;m then going to then have a crack at porting it to <a href="http://golang.org">Go</a>, which I think may turn out to be an excellent language for writing computer games.</p>

<p>I like films. Perchance you may have noticed. I may chat a bit more in depth about a couple of this year&#8217;s releases. Just to pick three with a common theme off the top of my head:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>The Amazing Spider-Man</strong>. I went to a preview event for this in Leicester Square a month or two ago and was very impressed with what I saw. I&#8217;m hopeful they made a Spider-Man movie in the same way that Christopher Nolan makes Batman movies. Really really.</li>
<li><strong>The Dark Knight Rises</strong>. Speaking of which. This <em>is</em> exciting. It&#8217;s the last of the trilogy. It&#8217;s got a lot to live up to, especially since the last film Nolan made was <em>Inception</em>. I wouldn&#8217;t bet against it, though.</li>
<li><strong>The Avengers</strong>. Now here&#8217;s a film with some scope. All these characters in one film? With this cast? Written and directed by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joss_Whedon">Joss Mother Fucking* Whedon</a>? Please, please let this film live up to the frankly stupid amount of potential it has.</li>
</ul>


<p>Quite recently, at the aforementioned age of 30, I started playing Dungeons and Dragons with a selection of my colleagues. Well, we&#8217;re actually playing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathfinder_Roleplaying_Game">Pathfinder</a>, but let us not quibble about semantics. I&#8217;m having a really great time on several different levels. It&#8217;s an interesting experience for someone who has played computer games for most of their life, but never dabbled in table top RPGs.</p>

<p>I mentioned before that I now have a shiny new PhD, with the letters before and after my name to prove it. I&#8217;m of the opinion that the work which led to this is quite interesting (but then I would be). It&#8217;s also not completely divorced from my Clockwork Aphid project. I&#8217;m of a mind to try talking about this some, also.</p>

<p>See you when we get there.</p>

<p>* I think these are his actual middle names.</p>

    <link href="http://www.harveynick.com/blog/2011/12/01/simplifying-the-landscape/"/>
    <updated>2011-12-01T09:28:05+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.harveynick.com/blog/2011/12/01/simplifying-the-landscape</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>At the end of the <a href="http://www.harveynick.com/blog/2010/10/22/now-in-eye-popping-3d/">last post</a> I wrote about the actual implementation of my Clockwork Aphid project, I said the next step was going to be display simplification. At that point I&#8217;d generated a few landscapes which were just starting barely starting to test the limits of my computer, though they were nothing like the size or complexity I had in mind. That said, it was looking at landscapes containing 1579008 polygons and it was obvious that not all of these needed to be put on screen. Moreover, because my landscapes are essentially made up of discrete samples (or nodes): I needed to reduce the number of samples which were displayed to the user, otherwise my performance was really going to tank as the landscapes increased in size.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Shamus Young talked about terrain simplification <a href="http://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?p=142">some time ago</a> during his original terrain project. This seemed as good a place as any to start, so I grabbed a copy of <a href="http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.14.4771">the paper</a> he used to build his algorithm. I didn&#8217;t find it as complicated as it appears he did, but this is probably because I&#8217;m more used to reading papers like this (I must have read hundreds during my PhD, and even wrote a couple), so I&#8217;m reasonably fluent in academicese. It was, as I suspected, a good starting point, though I wouldn&#8217;t be able to use the algorithm wholesale as it&#8217;s not directly compatible with the representation I&#8217;m using. Happily, my representation does make it very simple to use the core idea, though.</p>

<p>If you <a href="http://www.harveynick.com/blog/2010/10/19/youre-speaking-my-landscape-baby/">remember</a>, my representation stores the individual points in a sparse array, indexed using fractional coordinates. This makes it very flexible, and allows me to use an irregular level of detail (more on that later). Unlike the representation used in the paper, this means a can&#8217;t make optimisations based on the assumption that my data is stored in a regular grid. Thankfully, the first stage of the simplification algorithm doesn&#8217;t care about this and examines points individually. Also thankfully, the simplification algorithm uses the same parent/child based tessellation strategy that I do.</p>

<p>The first step is decide which points are &#8220;active&#8221;. This is essentially based on two variables:</p>

<ul>
<li>The amount of &#8220;object space error&#8221; a point has (i.e. how much it differs from its parents);</li>
<li>The distance between the point and the &#8220;camera&#8221;.</li>
</ul>


<p>A local constant is also present for each point:</p>

<ul>
<li>The point&#8217;s bounding radius, or the distance to its furthest child (if it has children);</li>
</ul>


<p>I&#8217;m not sure if I actually need this last in my current implementation (my gut says no, I&#8217;ll explain why later), but I&#8217;m leaving it in for the time being. Finally, two global constants are used for tuning, and we end up with this:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://harveynick.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/simplificationequation21.png"></p>

<p>Where:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>i</em> = the point in question</li>
<li><em>λ</em> = a constant</li>
<li><em>ε<sub>i</sub></em> = the object space error of <em>i</em></li>
<li><em>d<sub>i</sub></em> = the distance between <em>i</em> and the camera</li>
<li><em>r<sub>i</sub></em> = the bounding radius of <em>i</em></li>
<li><em>τ</em> = another constant</li>
</ul>


<p>This is not entirely optimal for processing, but a little bit of maths wizardry transforms this like so:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://harveynick.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/simplificationequation31.png"></p>

<p>This looks more complicated, and it&#8217;s less intuitive to see what it actually does, but from the point of view of the computer it&#8217;s a lot simpler, as it avoids the square root needed to calculate the distance between the point and the camera. Now we get to the fun part: diagrams! Consider the following small landscape, coloured as to the granularity of each of the points (aka the distance to the node&#8217;s parents, see <a href="http://www.harveynick.com/blog/2010/10/22/fractal-errata/">this post</a>):</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://harveynick.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/allpoints.jpg"></p>

<p>Next, we&#8217;ll pick some arbitrary values for the constants mentioned above (ones which work well for explanatory purposes), and place the viewpoint in the top left hand corner, and we end up with this the following active points (inactive points are hidden):</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://harveynick.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/activepoints.jpg"></p>

<p>Now, we take the active points with the smallest granularity, and we have them draw their polygons, <a href="http://www.harveynick.com/blog/2010/10/22/now-in-eye-popping-3d/">exactly as before</a>, which looks like this:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://harveynick.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/smallestpolygons.jpg"></p>

<p>When we come to draw the polygons of the next highest granularity you&#8217;ll see that we have a problem, though. The previous set of polygons have encroached on their territory. To avoid this, each node informs its parents that it is active and then the parent doesn&#8217;t draw any polygons in the direction of its active children. If we add in the polygons drawn by the each of the other levels of granularity, we now end up with this:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://harveynick.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/filledpolygons.jpg"></p>

<p>Oh no! There&#8217;s a hole in my landscape! I was actually expecting that my simplistic approach would lead to more or less this result, but it was still a little annoying when it happened. If I was a proper analytical type I would next have sat down and worked over the geometry at play here, then attempted to find a formulation which would prevent this from happening. Instead, though, I stared at it for a good long while, displaying it in various different ways, and waited for something to jump out at me.</p>

<p>Eventually it did, and thankfully it was a very simple rule. Each parent stores a list of the directions in which it has active children in order to prevent overdrawing (as mentioned above). The new rule is that a node is also considered active if this list is non-empty. With this addition, our tessellated landscape now look alike this:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://harveynick.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/backfilledpolygons.jpg"></p>

<p>Presto! A nice simple rule which fills in all of the gaps in the landscape without any over or under simplification, or any overdrawing. I suspect this rule also negates the need for the bounding radius mentioned above, though I have not as yet tested that thought. To recap, we have three simple rules:</p>

<ol>
<li>A node is active if the object space error/distance equation says it is;</li>
<li>A node is active if any of its children are active;</li>
<li>Polygons are tessellated for each active point, but not in the direction of any active children.</li>
</ol>


<p>But what does this look like in actual eye poppingly 3D landscapes? Well, here&#8217;s an example, using the height based colouring I&#8217;ve used before:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://harveynick.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/simplifiedlandscape.jpg"><!-- header_img http://harveynick.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/simplifiedlandscape.jpg --></p>

<p>I&#8217;m quite pleased with this, though what I&#8217;m doing here is still quite inefficient and in need of some serious tuning. There are a couple of further simplification tricks I can try (including the next step from the (paper) paper). More to come later. Honest.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Monday the 5th of September was Freddie Mercury day. The day he would have turned 65, had he lived. This makes me feel a little old, but that&#8217;s not the point. The day&#8217;s <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX2BQM0D01M">Google doodle</a> (pointed out to me with furious glee by one of my coworkers) led me to YouTube and numerous videos of Queen performing live. As I often do, I&#8217;d forgotten just how good they were. I spent much of the day fighting the urge to pump my fist and throw shapes at my desk*. Since I had so much fun with this, I&#8217;m going to pepper this post with some of the videos I found the most fun. Anything under the videos and written in italics is a comment on the video itself, and not strictly related to the rest of this post.</p>

<p><em>If you have to start somewhere, you might as well start here. File under: moments which made history.</em></p>

<p>As I was walking to the cinema yesterday to see <a href="http://ohsohumbleopinion.tumblr.com/post/10360864080/tinker-tailor-soldier-spy">Tinker Tailer Soldier Spy</a>, I found myself thinking back to the Queen videos, but also to the <a href="http://www.harveynick.com/blog/2011/08/07/film-related-blog-post/">post</a> I previously wrote about how much I hated the last two Transformers films, and how much I adored Fast 5. I started wondering if a person&#8217;s taste in music might be reflected in their taste in film. I have fairly eclectic fast in music. I like a bit of <em>Dido</em>, a bit of <em>Bjork</em>. I love me some <em>Avenged Sevenfold</em> and some <em>In Flames</em>. I&#8217;m as likely to throw on a bit of <em>Massive Attack</em> as I am a bit of <em>Linkin Park</em>. Today I might be listening to <em>At The Drive-In</em>, where as on my walk yesterday my choice of backdrop was <em>Spiritual Beggars</em>. Like my mother before me, I&#8217;m also a bit of a Queen fan.</p>

<iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/oozJH6jSr2U" width="" height="" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


<p><em>Obviously I have to include this one. Queen at their operatic best.</em></p>

<p>When challenged to name my favourite films, I&#8217;ve been picking the same five for quite some time (in no particular order):</p>

<ul>
<li>Fight Club;</li>
<li>American Beauty;</li>
<li>Donnie Darko;</li>
<li>Amelie;</li>
<li>The Matrix.</li>
</ul>


<p>I might also offer up three others I really love:</p>

<ul>
<li>Out of Sight;</li>
<li>Pitch Black;</li>
<li>X-Men**.</li>
</ul>


<p>Perhaps I might also add the first <em>Pirates of the Caribbean</em> film (or maybe <em>Zoolander</em>) to that list. Be that as it may, I&#8217;d say the list is reasonably eclectic. Not entirely evident in this list is my love of a really good action movie. <em>Bad Boys</em>. <em>The Transporter. Rambo (2008). Fast 5. Demolition Man. Army of Darkness. Welcome to the Jungle. The Long Kiss Goodnight. Die Hard.</em> I&#8217;m not going to try and match items from my musical taste to each of the films I&#8217;ve named here, because I don&#8217;t think the analogy is that exact, but I think Queen serves as an excellent peer to these action films.</p>

<iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/kXOOwNS2qk0" width="" height="" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


<p><em>I love this intro. That is how you work a crowd.</em></p>

<p>Freddie Mercury did not so much walk around the stage as stay perfectly still at the centre of everyone&#8217;s vision while the stage moved around him. He worked the crowd like a master while knocking every single note right out of the stadium. It wasn&#8217;t just about him, though. The band behind him was as tight as a gnat&#8217;s arse. Everything clicked together like the internals of a cuckoo clock. Queen songs were not generally high art, but they flowed brilliantly and they just <em>took hold</em> of you.</p>

<p>This is how a good action film should be. I want the characters to chew the scenery and have it feel right. I want the characters to be fleshed out enough to feel worthwhile. They don&#8217;t have to be Lester Burnham or Jack Foley, but I do need to give a shit about what happens to them. The plot should feel, if not possible, then plausible. If something doesn&#8217;t quite make sense then it should be okay because I&#8217;m having too much fun to care. I want to laugh joyously at the outrageousness of it. I want to feel like pumping my fist along with the protagonists&#8217; success and then leave the cinema with a huge smile on my face. I&#8217;ll listen to some Emilíana Torrini soon, there&#8217;ll be time enough for that later. Right now, <em>we are the champions</em>, baby!</p>

<iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/pCA6b36pCro" width="" height="" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


<p><em>A beautiful, melancholic and very appropriate song. Seems like a good place to stop.</em></p>

<p>* For the record: conversation with my coworkers has revealed to me that had I done so, I could simply have told them I was listening to a bit of Queen and this otherwise odd behaviour would have become at least marginally understandable.</p>

<p>** Yes, the first one. It has a wonderful lightness of touch and flow, which, though it doesn&#8217;t excuse the film&#8217;s complete lack of a third act, does make it very dear to me.</p>

    <updated>2011-09-14T10:00:14+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.harveynick.com/blog/2011/09/14/revisiting-the-language-issue</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Some time ago, I wrote a <a href="http://www.harveynick.com/blog/2010/10/09/youre-speaking-my-language-baby-part-1-introduction/">series</a> <a href="http://www.harveynick.com/blog/2010/10/10/youre-speaking-my-language-baby-part-2-java/">of</a> <a href="http://www.harveynick.com/blog/2010/10/11/youre-speaking-my-language-baby-part-3-c/">posts</a> <a href="http://www.harveynick.com/blog/2010/10/12/youre-speaking-my-language-baby-part-4-objective-c/">about</a> <a href="http://www.harveynick.com/blog/2010/10/13/youre-speaking-my-language-baby-part-5-conclusion/">language</a> choice for my Clockwork Aphid project. In the end I decided to start the project in Java, this being the language I&#8217;m most comfortable with. Once the project reaches a stable state, with some minimum amount of functionality, the plan is to port it to C++ for comparison purposes, this being the language which is likely to provide the best performance.</p>

<p>I still plan on doing this, but I&#8217;ve also decided to add a couple of extra candidate languages to the melting pot and get an even broader comparison. The first of these languages is Go, a relatively new language developed at Google. This is not coincidence. I&#8217;ve been doing some reading about it lately and finding a lot of things I really like. It has the potential to provide the benefits of both Java <em>and</em> C++, whilst avoiding many of the pitfalls. This is definitely a good thing. It will also give me chance to dogfood (there&#8217;s <a href="http://www.harveynick.com/blog/2011/08/26/dogfood-nom-nom-nom/">that word</a> again!) some more Google technology.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>One of Go&#8217;s features which I really like is implicit interfaces. Allow me to explain. In most regular statically typed object orientated languages, such as Java (which I&#8217;ll use for this example), you can abstract functionality using something like an interface. For example, let&#8217;s say I have a class which looks like this:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='java'><span class='line'><span class="kd">class</span> <span class="nc">Counter</span> <span class="o">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">value</span><span class="o">;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="nf">get</span><span class="o">()</span> <span class="o">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">value</span><span class="o">;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="o">}</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="o">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Here we have defined an class which declares a single method which returns an integer value. I might then make use of this an instance of this class elsewhere:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='java'><span class='line'><span class="kd">class</span> <span class="nc">Printer</span> <span class="o">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="kt">void</span> <span class="nf">update</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">Counter</span> <span class="n">counter</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">System</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">out</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">println</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">counter</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">get</span><span class="o">());</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="o">}</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="o">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>All is good with the world, unless I decide I want to change the behaviour of the code. Perhaps I want the value to increment after each call, for example. I could extend the Counter class and change its behaviour that way:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='java'><span class='line'><span class="kd">class</span> <span class="nc">IncrementingCounter</span> <span class="kd">extends</span> <span class="n">Counter</span> <span class="o">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="nf">get</span><span class="o">()</span> <span class="o">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">value</span><span class="o">++;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="o">}</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="o">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>I can now pass an instance of this new class into the update method of the Handler. Done. Right? Well&#8230; no. This is a bit of a clumsy way to go about this. It doesn&#8217;t scale and it&#8217;s not always possible. A better way to handle this is to use an interface:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='java'><span class='line'><span class="kd">interface</span> <span class="nc">CounterInterface</span> <span class="o">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="nf">get</span><span class="o">();</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="o">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This specifies the interface of the methods, but not their implementation. We can then change the Printer class to use this interface, rather than the concrete class:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='java'><span class='line'><span class="kd">class</span> <span class="nc">Printer</span> <span class="o">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="kt">void</span> <span class="nf">update</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">CounterInterface</span> <span class="n">counter</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">System</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">out</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">println</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">counter</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">get</span><span class="o">());</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="o">}</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="o">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Now any class which implements this interface can be passed to the Printer. So, going to back to our original example:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='java'><span class='line'><span class="kd">class</span> <span class="nc">Counter</span> <span class="kd">implements</span> <span class="n">CounterInterface</span> <span class="o">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">value</span><span class="o">;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="nf">get</span><span class="o">()</span> <span class="o">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">value</span><span class="o">;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="o">}</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="o">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>We can now make any number of alternative implementations (incrementing, decrementing, random, fibronatchi…) and as long as they implement the interface they can be passed to the printer. This is fine if you&#8217;re in control of the implementation, and even more fine if you&#8217;re in control of the interface as well. There are times, however, when you&#8217;re in change of neither. Things can get a little messy and you may have to find a way of pushing a round peg through a square hole.</p>

<p>In dynamically typed languages, such as Python and Ruby, things work a little differently. These languages are often referred to as being &#8220;duck&#8221; typed, as they make the assumption that if something &#8220;looks like a duck and quacks like a duck, treat it as though it&#8217;s a duck.&#8221; In this case we wouldn&#8217;t bother with any of the interfaces and our Printer class would look more like this:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='python'><span class='line'><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Printer</span><span class="p">:</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">update</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">counter</span><span class="p">):</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="k">print</span> <span class="n">counter</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">get</span><span class="p">()</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>So long as the counter object has a method called get() we don&#8217;t have a problem. Everything will be fine. This is much simpler, and is one of the things which makes Python very quick to program in, but it does have problems. The main problem (for me, at least) is specification. Without examining the source code, I can&#8217;t see what sort of object I have to pass into the update method. If the method has been manually commented then there&#8217;s no problem, but this is an incredible tedious thing to have to do. In the Java code I can see the type right there in the auto-generated documentation, and even if the writer has written no comments at all (what a bastard!) I can still get a good idea of what I need to pass into the method.</p>

<p>Go takes a different approach. It&#8217;s statically typed, and it has interfaces, but a class doesn&#8217;t need to state that it implements an interface. This is implicit and automatic. If a class has the methods defined in an interface, then it is automatically considered to implement it. You get the flexibility of Python with the specification and predicability of Java. This is just one of the things in Go which I think is a really good idea.</p>

<p>On the other hand, I think functional programming is a really stupid idea. I find the languages to be completely horrendous. I feel they must be created by the sort of people who think Linux is user friendly. I consider them curiosities whose only merit is academic. It appears to me that their major use case is to make programming appear more obscure than it actually is and to abstract way the programmer&#8217;s knowledge of what the computer is actually doing.</p>

<p>You may be surprised to learn, then, that the third language I&#8217;m going to be trying to port Clockwork Aphid into is Scala, a functional programming language. The reason for this is simple: while I personally believe that functional programming (FP) is rubbish, many people disagree. Not a majority, but certainly a very vocal minority. Within Google this minority is very vocal in indeed. The word &#8220;fundamentalists&#8221; might be appropriate to describe them. When someone believes something that hard it makes me very curious. This is turn tends to lead me towards testing my own beliefs. Sometimes I discover something new and exciting which I was missing out on previously*, and sometimes my initial suspicions are confirmed**. We&#8217;ll see which way it goes with Scala.</p>

<p>* Such as the Harry Potter books, which I had stubbornly refused to read until just before the first film was released.<br/>
** Such as when I noticed that the Twilight books had taken up the first four places on the Waterstone&#8217;s chart and decided I aught to find out what all the fuss was about.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You may or may not be aware that, though I now lived in London and previously lived in Edinburgh, I&#8217;m originally from South Yorkshire. Since I visited my parents this weekend for my father&#8217;s 60th birthday*, I though I&#8217;d take a moment to talk about a couple of Yorkshire related titbits which have crossed my mind recently.</p>

<p>The first is the fact that no matter how far you go from your your roots, they have a way of inserting themselves into your life in unexpected places. The other day (or &#8220;t&#8217;other day&#8221; if we&#8217;re going to be properly Yorkshire about this) I was walking through Waterloo train station on my way to meet some friends for dinner. There&#8217;s a theatre attached to the station which is showing &#8220;The Railway Children&#8221;, and thus it has been named &#8220;The Yorkshire Theatre&#8221;. Next to the theatre is a booth organised by &#8220;Visit Yorkshire&#8221;, which is essentially the Yorkshire Tourist Board. As is often the case with these booths, it has a couple of large posters showing sights intended to entice you to… well… visit Yorkshire.</p>

<p>So far, so normal, but the beautiful yet ruined abbey in one of the pictures looked very familiar indeed. In fact, it looked a lot like the very beautiful yet ruined abbey just outside my otherwise almost entirely unremarkable home town. A little bit of Googling later and I confirmed that, sure enough, there was a great big picture of Roche Abbey sitting in Waterloo train station. See for yourself:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://www.ntopsearch.com/media/images/f/f/ffba50d6-a214-4204-8fe8-9562dae62447/ffba50d6-a214-4204-8fe8-9562dae62447.jpg"><!-- header_img http://www.ntopsearch.com/media/images/f/f/ffba50d6-a214-4204-8fe8-9562dae62447/ffba50d6-a214-4204-8fe8-9562dae62447.jpg --></p>

<p>Maltby was once a proud coal mining town, but those days are very much gone. Now it&#8217;s mostly a hub for people who commute into the surrounding larger towns and cities. There&#8217;s not a lot here. To my knowledge, not even a Starbucks or Subway. Thus, it was a pleasant surprise to see one of the local sights held up next to the Jorvic Viking Centre as one of the main attractions in Yorkshire. Go us.</p>

<p>Something which is potentially less of an attraction in Yorkshire is the people. They&#8217;re not unfriendly, but but they can seem a little cold, and don&#8217;t aways warm to a person as quickly as they might. Know this, though: if I Yorkshireman calls you friend, he <em>means</em> it**. There is also strong streak on competitiveness in the Yorkshire folk, and a fierce pride in working class roots, though it feels as though this is being eroded in Yorkshire as it is everywhere in the UK. Some years ago, Monty Python sent this up almost perfectly in what I consider to be the finest comedy sketch every written:</p>

<iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/Xe1a1wHxTyo" width="" height="" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


<p>(There&#8217;s also an alternative version <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eDaSvRO9xA">here</a>)</p>

<p>I say best written because the performance does not, in my opinion, quite live up to the writing. The delivery is fantastic, but most of the accents aren&#8217;t quite right. But still, <em>beggars can&#8217;t me choosers</em>. Also: <em>waste not, want not</em>, and <em>close your mouth, there&#8217;s a bus coming</em>.</p>

<p>* This makes me feel old, but I suspect it makes him feel older&#8230;<br/>
** The same, of course, goes for the ladies of Yorkshire, but &#8220;Yorkshireman&#8221; scans so much better than any unisex pronoun I could think of.</p>

    <updated>2011-08-26T09:00:04+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.harveynick.com/blog/2011/08/26/dogfood-nom-nom-nom</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Dog food, the common noun, is reasonably self explanatory (pro tip: it&#8217;s food for dogs). Dogfood the verb or dogfooding the verbal noun, though, might require a little bit of explanation.</p>

<p>At the root of it is this: if you make dog food, you should feed it to your own dogs. There are essentially two reasons for this:</p>

<ol>
<li>If you don&#8217;t personally test it, how will know if it&#8217;s any good?</li>
<li>If your dogs don&#8217;t eat it, why the hell should anyone else&#8217;s?</li>
</ol>


<p>The same principle applies to software.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Even more so in fact, as it&#8217;s something you&#8217;re more able to test directly. As a simple example: in Google, we use Google docs for most documentation purposes (design docs, presentations, etc.). I&#8217;m willing to bet that folks at Apple use iWork for much the same purpose. I&#8217;m absolutely certain that Microsoft employes use Office, excepting those times when it&#8217;s necessary to write a document in the blood of a green eyed virgin upon the pressed skin of an albino goat.</p>

<p>This process is called dogfooding. You use the software internally before it&#8217;s released to users, ensuring that it gets a lot more test usage. As an added bonus, developers who actually use the software they create are more likely to create software that&#8217;s actually worth using. That&#8217;s not always the case, of course, since most developers don&#8217;t really fall into the &#8220;average users&#8221; category. Case in point: upgrading my computer to Lion broke my installation of Steam. I fixed it with a quick command line incantation, then performed a couple more in order to make <a href="http://www.moddb.com/mods/the-stanley-parable">The Stanley Parable</a> functional under OSX. Most computer users would not be comfortable doing something like this, nor should they have to.</p>

<p>As well as using your company&#8217;s products at work, it&#8217;s generally a good idea to use them at home. It&#8217;s always good to have a feel for what your company actually does and get more experience with it. I&#8217;ve used Google search more or less exclusively for at least ten years. That&#8217;s not really a hard choice. It gives the best results. Likewise, I started using Google Chrome is my main web browser pretty much as soon as it was available for the platforms I used (in my last job that was actually Windows, OSX and Linux). I use iPhone in preference to Android, however, though I do have an upgrade due me towards the end of the year and it&#8217;s not completely inconceivable that I might switch. For the time being at least, I&#8217;m definitely sticking with Wordpress, so I won&#8217;t get to play with Blogger, Google Analytics or AdSense, either.</p>

<p>As well as dogfooding Google products at work, we also dogfood technologies and platforms. This sounds fairly obvious, but it&#8217;s not always the case with companies who create platform technology. Microsoft, for instance, used to be famous for not using the technologies they provided to developers internally, though they are getting better now. Some of Google&#8217;s technologies are open source, and thus available for everyone to use. <a href="http://code.google.com/p/google-guice/">Guice</a> and <a href="http://code.google.com/p/protobuf/">Protocol Buffers</a> are pretty good examples of this. Guice is amazing, by the way. This being the case, there&#8217;s nothing to stop me using them on personal projects, should that be appropriate. Personal projects such as Clockwork Aphid, for example.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll talk about which particular Google technologies I think might be useful in later blog posts, but since I brought it up, I suppose I should probably say something about Clockwork Aphid. I&#8217;ve blown the dust off the code, tweaked a couple of things and got a feature I&#8217;d left half finished back on track. I tried switching my current implementation from jMonkeyEngine version 2 to version 3, only to find that while it does appear a lot faster and improved in several other ways, the documentation is pretty crappy, and it&#8217;s less… functional.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll talk about that more later, but for now just know that things are once again happening.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I finally broke.</p>

<p>I’ve been saying for some time that if the Kindle, or a similarly capable eReader, went under the £100 mark I would splash out and buy one. Until quite recently I had been quite tempted, but this condition was never satisfied. Had I seen one for sale in a bricks and mortar store while I was over in the US of A, I think I probably would have just snapped it up, dollar to stirling exchange rates and relative prices being what they are. But I didn’t, so I didn’t.</p>

<p>Then, suddenly, out of the blue, I just happened to be on the Amazon Kindle page by shear chance, in no way fighting the urge to just say “sod it” and bloody well buy one, when I noticed the word “refurbished” in the pricing options. More interesting to me were the numerals to the right of the word. Eighty of your British pounds.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Snap.</p>

<p>To cut a fairly short story down to the bare minimum: I have a Kindle now. The fact that it’s refurbished doesn’t bother me in the slightest. In actual fact this would tend to mean that it has passed a more rigorous set of tests, and still has the full guarantee. Also, it was cheaper. Did I mention that?</p>

<p>So what do I think of this bit of kit? It’s very pleasing indeed, and plays very nicely with my tendency to read books which might more accurately be called “tomes”. Right now that’s George R. R. Martins long and impatiently awaited “A Dance With Dragons”, a book which, if you fell asleep whilst holding it above your face, might conceivably knock you into some sort of Inception esque deeper dream. The kindle, however, has about the size and weight of a molskine journal, making it small enough to fit into some pockets, and light enough to be carried comfortably in the hand or slung in a bag.</p>

<p>It has that slightly strange blinky page turn which is common to the current generation of eInk displays, but that doesn’t really bother me at all. At times it reminds me of shifting black and white sand, particularly when changing to and from the screen savers, which I actually find quite pleasing. I’d like it if they play this up in future versions, rather than just making the page turn quicker, but I suspect that would be a bit of a waste of resou… I mean… er… valuable functionality indicative of a mature company sure of its own capabilities and comfortable with its place in the world. It seems only right that such a company should furnish us with an eReader which acts like something straight out of the <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Diamond-Age-Neal-Stephenson/dp/0241953197/ref=ntt_at_ep_dpt_12">Diamond Age</a>, no?</p>

<p>It’s not all sweetness and light, though. I do have two significant complaints. Firstly, when you turn the device off it shifts into a randomly selected screen saver image from a pool which is preloaded on the device. This is not what I want it to do. I want it to show the cover of the book which I’m actually reading. At this point you may have figured out that my complaints are not, in fact, all that significant at all. This one does annoy me a disproportionate amount though. It just seems so obvious.</p>

<p>The second, equally earth shaking, complaint relates to the progress information along the bottom of the screen. This gives the percentage progress through the book together with a progress bar. I’m told the dots on the progress bar represent chapters, but when the book you’re reading is about a bazillion pages long this is less than helpful. Something iBooks does which I really like is tell you how many pages remain of the current chapter. If I’m reading in bed, for instance, then this is  exactly the information I’m looking for. I suspect there is a way of showing more information here, but I haven’t found it yet.</p>

<p>Something else which pushed me towards the purchase of this particular object of desire was the imminent release of new books by three of my favourite authors.</p>

<p>The first is &#8221;<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Reamde-Neal-Stephenson/dp/1848874480/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1314052707&amp;sr=8-1">Reamde</a>&#8221; by Neal Stephenson. I usually love Stephenson, and the synopsis really makes it sound as though he might be firing on all cylinders:</p>

<blockquote><p>Across the globe, millions of computer screens flicker with the artfully coded world of T&#8217;Rain - an addictive internet role-playing game of fantasy and adventure. But backstreet hackers in China have just unleashed a contagious virus called Reamde, and as it rampages through the gaming world spreading from player to player - holding hard drives hostage in the process - the computer of one powerful and dangerous man is infected, causing the carefully mediated violence of the on-line world to spill over into reality. A fast-talking, internet-addicted mafia accountant is brutally silenced by his Russian employers, and Zula - a talented young T&#8217;Rain computer programmer - is abducted and bundled on to a private jet. As she is flown across the skies in the company of the terrified boyfriend she broke up with hours before, and a brilliant Hungarian hacker who may be her only hope, she finds herself sucked into a whirl of Chinese Secret Service agents and gun-toting American Survivalists; the Russian criminal underground and an al-Qaeda cell led by a charismatic Welshman; each a strand of a connected world that devastatingly converges in T&#8217;Rain.</p></blockquote>


<p>Sounds insane, right? This is another monster of a book, but right now there is no Kindle edition listed, disappointingly. Still, I have my fingers crossed. The next is Terry Pratchett&#8217;s latest. I hate to say it, but Pratchett&#8217;s last couple of books haven&#8217;t really been up to his usual standard, in my opinion. &#8221;<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Snuff-Discworld-Sir-Terry-Pratchett/dp/038561926X/ref=pd_sim_b_6">Snuff</a>&#8221; is a Vimes book, though, so I have high hopes:</p>

<blockquote><p>It is a truth universally acknowledged that a policeman taking a holiday would barely have had time to open his suitcase before he finds his first corpse.  </p><p>And Commander Sam Vimes of the Ankh-Morpork City Watch is on holiday in the pleasant and innocent countryside, but not for him a mere body in the wardrobe. There are many, many bodies and an ancient crime more terrible than murder.  </p><p>He is out of his jurisdiction, out of his depth, out of bacon sandwiches, and occasionally snookered and out of his mind, but never out of guile. Where there is a crime there must be a finding, there must be a chase and there must be a punishment.  </p><p>They say that in the end all sins are forgiven.  </p><p>But not quite all&#8230;</p></blockquote>


<p>Finally, we have &#8221;<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Manhattan-Reverse-Peter-F-Hamilton/dp/0230750303/ref=pd_sim_b_1">Manhattan in Reverse</a>&#8221;, a book of short stories by Peter F. Hamilton. No one does overblown space opera quite so well as Hamilton, in my opinion, but his short stories can be a little spotty. I have no complaints about getting a bit more Paula Mayo, though, so count me in.<br/>
The fun thing, though, is that I found the second two books on the suggestions list for the first. Amazon, methinks you have a little too much the measure of me.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Well. These are certainly interesting times to be living in London. Interesting times to be living in England full stop, in fact. In particular, I definitely picked an ideal time to move to Clapham.</p>

<p>I have a bad habit of being more or less completely oblivious to what&#8217;s going on in the world, unless it happens in either the tech or movie industries. I subscribe to those blogs and news sites, but I rarely read the paper or turn on the news, so something has to land with quite a thud, more or less in my lap, for me to notice it much of the time. When a waitress walks into the restaurant in which I&#8217;m eating and announces that riots have kicked off just outside the station I arrived via around twenty minutes earlier, though, <em>that</em> is something I notice. Likewise, when I can hear the sirens from my bedroom window and see the helicopters flying overhead, I pay attention.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Politics is something I don&#8217;t really talk about on this blog, and often avoid discussing in real life. Here, my passion far out ways my knowledge, and this combination amounts to quite the metaphorical JCB when it comes to digging oneself metaphorical hole. That said: I feel recent events merit some comment. Others have already done so, and with eloquence which exceeds my own. <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2011/aug/11/london-riots-davidcameron">Russell Brand</a> (yes, that Russell Brand; whom I continue to find myself impressed with as a writer, scarily enough) and <a href="http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/peteroborne/100100708/the-moral-decay-of-our-society-is-as-bad-at-the-top-as-the-bottom/">Peter Oborne</a> being two who&#8217;ve stood out to me. Fair warning: I&#8217;ve read these articles and the writers&#8217; opinions have informed my own.</p>

<p>Frankly: something stinks in British society right now, and it has been ripe for quite some time. It&#8217;s only that this summer has finally circulated the odour more fully. The particular element of this bouquet which stands out to me the most is entitlement. We have a whole lot of people in Britain right now who think you receive things because you&#8217;re entitled to them. That you become a musician or a celebrity by appearing on a reality television show. That the world owes you and if you&#8217;re not receiving then it&#8217;s okay to just reach out and take. That where possible you should cheat the system and ring out every last drop that you can. Ask not what you can do for your country, but what your country can do for you.</p>

<p>Now, I&#8217;ve never really known hardship. Not true hardship which my grandparents would recognise it as such. I once had calluses upon my hands, but now they&#8217;re soft and if I want to use the phrase &#8220;I work wi&#8217; me &#8216;ands&#8221; I have to add &#8220;on a keyboard,&#8221; sotto voce. I&#8217;ve been close to personally destitute more than once, but I could always have solved the problem with a phone call and an ingestion of pride. Realistically, I have no <em>real</em> first hand knowledge of just how bad it can get. Those who rioted last week, were not, for the most part, stealing food, though. They were stealing Nike trainers and 42&#8221; televisions.</p>

<p>42 inches. That&#8217;s a big television. It fired off a question in my head: What is the difference between a looter who steals (say) £800 worth of television during a riot, and a <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/mps-expenses/5330816/Sir-Gerald-Kaufmans-1800-rug-and-an-8865-claim-for-a-television-MPs-expenses.html">politician</a> who bills the state for an £8000 Bang &amp; Olufsen television?</p>

<p>I think the main difference is that the politician doesn&#8217;t make you worried about your own physical safety. If you were to choose which of these two people you wished to encounter in a dark alley, you would probably choose the second. It&#8217;s one hell of a lot easier to look down upon the former too, isn&#8217;t it? To see their act as that of a barbarian, rather than a scampish little white collar criminal. I put it to you, though, that while there may be many deep differences between the individuals, the differences between the two specific acts in question are mostly superficial. In both cases the individual decided they were entitled to something which they had not earned, and then obtained it through the most expedient means available to them.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not trying to excuse those who rioted or looted in any way. I don&#8217;t deny that many of them may have had legitimate grounds for protest, but you kind of loose the high ground when you knock over The Car Phone Warehouse and run off with a crate of iPhones. What I&#8217;m saying is this: what we saw this month was a symptom, and what scares me the most is that I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;re even close to a diagnoses of the actual disease, let alone any real notion of what the cure might be.</p>

<p>One last point, and I think this is important. I think Peter Oborne got something dead wrong in the article I linked to above. Specifically, in the tittle: &#8220;The moral decay of our society is as bad at the top as the bottom,&#8221; and more specifically in his use of the words &#8220;top&#8221; and &#8220;bottom&#8221;.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bottom&#8221; is a dangerous word to use here. A divisive word, and the divides in our society are almost certainly part of the problem. We really need a lot more &#8220;us&#8221; and a lot less &#8220;them&#8221;.</p>

<p>&#8220;Top&#8221;, though, is just plain the wrong word. Britain is, on paper, a monarchy. Functionally, though, we&#8217;re a parliamentary democracy. This means that our politicians are <em>not</em> above us. They are not a ruling aristocracy, regardless of what the Tories would prefer. They work for us. They are, at most, our equals.</p>

<p>If you have a comment to make, regardless of whether you agree of disagree, I encourage you to leave it below. If it&#8217;s uncivil I am going to either delete it or make fun of you, though.</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[Film Related Blog Post]]></title>
    <link href="http://www.harveynick.com/blog/2011/08/07/film-related-blog-post/"/>
    <updated>2011-08-07T11:27:03+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.harveynick.com/blog/2011/08/07/film-related-blog-post</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>“Given that you’ve just told us that the second one is one of the worst films you’ve ever seen,” asked Pete, “why on earth did you feel the need to go and see the third one?”</p>

<p>It was a good question. In all fairness I do not have good explanation as to why I paid actual money to see <em>Transformers: Dark of the Moon</em> in the cinema. I suppose I was relying mostly on hope. I mean, we’re talking about a film which is, at its core, about giant robots fighting. It really should be quite hard to get that wrong. The plot doesn’t need to be much, it just has to work. The first Transformers film just about held together, and I had a reasonable amount of fun with it. There was something extremely soulless about it, though. Something clearly went wrong somewhere, but I thought there was potential.</p>

<p>So I went to see the second film. I thought perhaps it would be better. Maybe it would hold on to the good bits of the first film and shore up everything else. It had Tony Todd as the villain, after all. Surely that meant nothing could go wrong?</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>It was basically gibberish. Not just gibberish, though: offensive gibberish. I felt as though the film assumed I was an idiot. Some blindingly obvious details were explained in ridiculous detail, whilst the plot had more holes than… well… plot. Half the movie just plain didn’t make any sense. On the one hand it seems to think you’re so stupid you need things explaining to you, on the other it thinks you’re so oblivious that that you’ll ignore massive inconsistencies and holes in the plot. Half the film just felt like dead space. If I go to see a film called “Transformers” that’s what I expect to to see. Giant robots which turn into cars and such. I don’t want five minutes of a pointless character’s even more pointless mother accidentally getting high on hash brownies and the ensuing “hilarity”.</p>

<p>Was there action in the film? Yes. Was it good? Some of it. Did it make up for the rest of the film’s shortcomings? Hell no. To some extent, that’s not even the worse part, though. The worse part is that the actual Transformers aren’t even really in the film that much. The film mostly follows Shia’s character and… two other robots. Skidz and Mudflap are “comic relief”, sort of like how Jar Jar was “comic relief” in <em>The Phantom Menace</em>. They are… stupid, ignorant, illiterate and really, really annoying. That might be tolerable if they at least did something moderately cool. If, out of nowhere, they turned out to be quite bad ass. They don’t. The kindest word I can really use to describe them is “bumbling”. Are they racist? I’m not going to get into that. I felt like I was watching cringeworthy stereotypes closely resembling the scene in Bad Boys II when Will Smith and Martin Lawrence go a bit “ghetto”. Others would say that makes <em>me</em> the racist. I don’t know. I’ll let you make your own <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91tLruQjd2s">mind up</a>.</p>

<p>So why in the name of all that is good and pure did I go and see the third film? The trailer looked quite good. It also looked as though the Transformers were actually in it. Perhaps there would be some really good action, and perhaps this time around it might also have a script.</p>

<p><em>sigh</em></p>

<p>Not as such. There <em>is</em> some really great action in the film. Spectacular, even. There’s a car chase mid way through which is stunning. Balletic, even. The level of artistry which has gone into its creation is really quite staggering. The rest of the film, though? Gibberish. Again. Half of it literally makes no sense. The plot manages to be both paper thin and self contradictory. It’s also weird. Things I didn’t need to see:</p>

<ul>
<li>Dr. Ken straddling Shia and declaring himself “deep wang”;</li>
<li>Bumble Bee pushing over and ticking an orange John Malkovich;</li>
<li>Shia’s parents. Again. This time his Mum wants to give him a sex manual.</li>
</ul>


<p>“It’s an action film, though!” you might declare.</p>

<p>To which I reply: “So?”</p>

<p>There is no rule which says an action film can’t have a good plot and compelling characters. I love a good action film. I put it to you that Fast 5 was such a film. It was, in my opinion, a near perfect film. Note my use of the indefinite article there, because that’s important. No film is perfect, and there is no one perfect film, even when we’re talking about ideals. But Fast 5 had a plot which fit together quite well, in my opinion. It had actual characters. Broadly drawn character for the most part, to be sure, but with enough nuance to make them work. It was so much fun that when the characters stopped for an inappropriate street race or spent much of the third act flagrantly ignoring the laws of physics, I just plain didn’t care. I was having too much fun. On more than one occasion it confounded my expectations. <del>The Rock</del> Dwayne Johnson pretty much <em>eats</em> every single scene he’s in. I spent most of the film with a huge grin on my face. When I didn’t have have the grin it was usually because I was laughing. There were a couple of places where I had to stop myself from clapping.</p>

<p><em>That</em> is what I’m looking for in an action film, and don’t think that is in any way an unreasonable expectation.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>&#8230;would make significantly more noise than I have on this blog, as of late.</p>

<p>There are a couple of reasons for this. The main one is that I don&#8217;t actually have the internet in my new flat yet, and won&#8217;t for another 9 days. Bloody Virgin Media. Serves me right for not going with media which has a bit more experience, I suppose. I&#8217;m writing this at work, which is something I really don&#8217;t like to do, but it&#8217;s very much the end of the day and I&#8217;m in late because I started late. I figure: a quick post can&#8217;t hurt.</p>

<p>Another reason is that my life has been incredibly complicated for the last couple of weeks. I have been bounced around all over the place. I also missed a flight, an expensive mistake I may devote a blog entry to at some point, now that my (partially self directed) rage has subsided, since it has some comedy value.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>More importantly: my paternal grandmother died. There&#8217;s really no way to sugar coat that fact. To head off inevitable questions:</p>

<p>Yes, we were close. In point of fact she basically raised me. I probably loved her more than anyone else in the entire world. I was also her only grandchild.</p>

<p>Yes, I am okay. I will be okay. I knew that day was coming. She had been ill in one form or another for basically my entire life and the years were being increasingly unkind.</p>

<p>No, that did not make it any easier. I cried for more or less the entire funeral, and I have no qualms (zero!) about broadcasting that fact over the internet. I was very glad to have my family and some close friends who knew my Nan there with me.</p>

<p>It is not my intention for this post to be macabre, though. For one thing my grandmother would not have wanted that. I mainly wanted to just check-in and indicate that this blog is still around, and more posts will be forthcoming. Especially now that: a) I have my computer back, and b) <a href="http://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?p=11874">Shamus Young</a> and <a href="http://www.sea-of-memes.com/">Michael Goodfellow</a> are making significantly more progress than I on their procedural generation projects. I am jealous of this.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll be back with more to say soon. Future topics of conversation will include: why I hate RyanAir, donuts, and dog food. Yes, dog food.</p>

<p>RIP Cath / Kath Johnson*</p>

<p>* Funny story about my Nan: no one is 100% sure of what her first name actually was.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s the new teaser poster for David Fincher&#8217;s adaptation of Stieg Larsson&#8217;s fantastic <em>The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo</em>:</p>

<p><a href="http://dragontattoo.com/"><img class="center" src="http://geektyrant.com/storage/post-images-2011/girlwithadragonTatnsfw.jpeg"></a></p>

<p>Note: I&#8217;ve nabbed this picture from WikiPedia. It&#8217;s small so that it counts as fair use (apparently). If you click it, you&#8217;ll be taken to the films official website, where you can see a bigger version, though you might have to pinky swear that you&#8217;re old enough to see it. The site also has the teaser trailer, but I&#8217;ll get to that.</p>

<p>Update: It seems they&#8217;ve taken it off the official site. You can find it at the Total Film website <a href="http://www.totalfilm.com/news/rooney-mara-goes-topless-in-girl-with-a-dragon-tattoo-poster">here</a>.</p>

<p>I like this poster quite a bit, though I am slightly confused as to whether the tag line is supposed to be:</p>

<blockquote><p>Evil shall with evil be expelled.</p></blockquote>

<p>Which kind of feels as though it needs a comma to me (though I&#8217;m not 100% certain where), or:</p>

<blockquote><p>Evil shall be expelled with evil.</p></blockquote>

<p>Which perhaps scans slightly better, but is definitely not how you would normally reads words written in that arrangement. In some ways I think I prefer the slightly more archaic feel of the first one.</p>

<p>Update 2: The version of the trailer on the official site has been updated. It&#8217;s definitely the first one.</p>

<p>I <a href="http://harveynick.wordpress.com/2009/09/20/just-cant-recommend-highly-enough/">outright love</a> the book this is based on (and was confused as all hell when <a href="http://www.dougalstanton.net/blog/index.php/2010/09/02/three-books-swedish-crime-allegorical-tales-and-first-person-shooters/">Dougal didn&#8217;t</a>). I did really enjoyed the original Swedish adaptation, but I have high hopes for any David Fincher film and this is no exception. I&#8217;m not thinking of it as a remake, more a reinterpretation.</p>

<p>I think Daniel Craig is really good casting for Mikael Blomkvist, and I&#8217;m pretty impressed with the way Rooney Mara is looking as Lisbeth Salander. In the books, at least, the point is made that Lisbeth would be incredibly attractive if she wasn&#8217;t far, far too thin. Mission accomplished. I can&#8217;t wait to hear them speaking, though it is going to be strange without the Swedish accent. Craig is uniformly fantastic, and Mara definitely held her own, and even stood out, in <a href="http://ohsohumbleopinion.tumblr.com/post/9851518911/the-social-network">The Social Network</a>.</p>

<p>What was also released recently was the teaser trailer, which looks a little bit like this:</p>

<iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/QrQ433ChAQM" width="" height="" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


<p>This is definitely a trailer for people who&#8217;ve read the book, I think. I saw it in the cinema with <a href="http://ohsohumbleopinion.tumblr.com/post/9851924500/x-men-first-class">X-Men First Class</a>, and the guy sat next to me had a fairly strong negative reaction of the &#8220;what the hell was that?&#8221; variety. To me, though, it looks great. Fincher&#8217;s artistry is legendary and I think this film is going to have a lot of impact. It&#8217;s going to be dark, and <em>very</em> difficult to watch in places. This is a story about incredibly complex and compelling characters. This does not mean that they are nice people, and their story is a difficult one. If I had to pick a word to describe what I think this film will be like, it would be: <em>uncompromising</em>.</p>

<p>I look forward to taking my double espresso with a teaspoon of milk this Christmas, even if I do feel as though I need to take a bath afterwards.</p>

    <updated>2011-06-06T02:36:54+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.harveynick.com/blog/2011/06/06/full-nerd-ii-nerd-harder</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It seems that people really enjoyed my post about the <a href="http://www.harveynick.com/blog/2011/06/03/in-which-i-go-full-nerd-2/">computer history museum</a>. At the time I wrote it, I was worried that it might constitute just a little bit too much nerd, so I held back on my initial impulse to put in more pictures and gush enthusiastically about how awesome it all was.</p>

<p>With hindsight, perhaps I can afford to ignore that particular mental stopcock, at least for a little while. I do not, I regret to tell you, have anymore pictures of <em>the</em> teapot. I do intend to buy myself a Melitta teapot at some point quite soon, however, so that it may sit in my flat and act as a most nerdy in-joke.</p>

<!-- more -->




<blockquote><p>&#8220;Tea, anyone?&#8221;  <br/>&#8220;Yes, please.&#8221;  <br/>Pause.  <br/>&#8220;Why are you grinning like that?&#8221;</p></blockquote>


<p>I do, however, have pictures of many other fun things. Let&#8217;s start with a reference to my current employer:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2561/5798552483_0c9a55f471.jpg"></p>

<p>This is one of the original Google server racks. At one point, if you typed a query into the Google homepage, this is where the magic happened. If you have any familiarity at all with how servers usually look, you might be scratching your heading and thinking that this one does not look entirely right. Let me help you with that:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3596/5799103540_e8c797886d.jpg"></p>

<p>Yes, you can see all of the components. No, that is not normal. Yes, each individual server would normally have its own case. No, under normal circumstances sheets of cardboard would not be used as the insulation between motherboard and shelf. Yes, that is an awful lot of servers to fit into a single rack. Yes again, that would require very good air circulation, but you&#8217;ll have a bloody difficult time finding a case that gives better circulation than no case at all. No, you would not expect a server to bow in the middle like that&#8230;</p>

<p>Two things the early Google was known for: providing the best search results; and being very, very frugal when it came to equipment purchasing.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s talk about something a bit more fundamental, though. Hard disks, for example. The one in the computer I&#8217;m writing this on has a capacity of around 120 GB (depending on how you measure a giga byte, but that&#8217;s a different story). Wikipedia tells me that is measures around 69.85 mm × 15 mm × 100 mm, so quite small. This is also a hard drive:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2432/5798550925_2b0852594f.jpg"></p>

<p>Assuming I haven&#8217;t gotten mixed up here somewhere, this is the worlds first hard disk, and is made up of 50 24&#8221; disks, holding a grand total of 5 million characters. Now, if  each of those characters is a one byte ASCII character (or similar) that&#8217;s approximately 5 MB, or 0.005 GB. Quite the difference in storage density, no?</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s a (slightly) more recent example of a hard disk, one which I&#8217;m told is actually still in use to some extent:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2057/5798550747_4ba81989e3.jpg"></p>

<p>Now, if my understanding is correct, this next piece looks like a hard drive, but is much closer in function to RAM:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2197/5798550973_6d011d98a4.jpg"><!-- header_img http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2197/5798550973_6d011d98a4.jpg --></p>

<p>What&#8217;s particularly neat is that it&#8217;s based on an original design by the regrettably late, extremely great, and utterly brilliant Alan Turing.<br/>
The museum has an entire section devoted to the evolution of storage, and it&#8217;s quite fascinating. Another of the forebears of modern RAM is magnetic core memory, which looks like this:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5023/5798550969_307c5c0b9b.jpg"></p>

<p>Now that&#8217;s quite cool, but I&#8217;d say that it&#8217;s also quite pleasing to the eye. I think I&#8217;d happily frame that, mount it, and have it hanging from the wall in my flat (somewhere close to the teapot). People walk through castles and talk in hushed tones of all the many things &#8220;these stones&#8221; have seen. All of the stories they might tell, if they could only speak. But this&#8230; unlike your average rock, this is unquestionably <em>memory</em>, and memory which lived through very exciting times in the development of our society. Here&#8217;s something I look at and wonder what stories it might be able to tell, and what stories it has been forced to forget.</p>

<p>There are many things at the Computer History Museum which are very cool and certainly raise a smile (as well as an appreciative thought as to how far things have come). There are also things which just plain stop you in your tracks; the Difference Engine, for example. Well, at the risk of repeating myself, I&#8217;m going to post another picture of it, this time from the other side, so you can see a little bit more of the mechanism:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5154/5799104044_672ed38476.jpg"></p>

<p>Now there&#8217;s a thing I would really and truly <em>love</em> to have in my flat. Ideally in a more coffee table friendly size, of course.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If a person were to walk from downtown Mountain View (in so far as Mountain View has a town to be down of) to the Computer History Museum, and then kept going, they might find themselves wandering into Shoreline Business Park. This is where you would find the silicon in this part of the valley.</p>

<p>Of course, there isn&#8217;t actually a lot of touristing to do in your average industrial park. We&#8217;re in Silicon Valley here, though, surely there must be something to see? Well&#8230; there are signs for reasonably exciting tech companies, with logos and everything&#8230; for example:</p>

<!-- more -->


<p><img class="center" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3005/5799103956_bc27e02f68.jpg"><!-- header_img http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3005/5799103956_bc27e02f68.jpg --></p>

<p>Here&#8217;s a fun one. 23 and Me is either a very cool company, or an utterly terrifying one, depending on your point of view. The basic idea is that you send them some of your spit (and some money). They use this to do some basic DNA profiling and tell you about your genetic predisposition towards certain diseases, your genetic predisposition to certain drugs, and a limited amount regarding your actual genetic ancestry. This all comes wrapped up in a neat web interface which updates as new discoveries are made. I&#8217;m generally of the the view that this is pretty cool.</p>

<p>Further in we find even more companies, at least one of which you might have even heard of:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3123/5799103942_418f7a2a37.jpg"></p>

<p>LinkedIn is basically a professional version Facebook. Sort of a fancy online business card holder, networking centre, recruitment system and industry conference all rolled into one. As such, it allows you to show your respectable side to your business contacts, whilst still being able to display that photo set proving that you <em>can</em> get your entire fist in your mouth to your friends. It can be quite useful, but more on that in a moment. I had no idea who the other companies on the sign are, and have not, as yet, felt too much of a need to enlighten myself.</p>

<p>There is, of course, another tech company with a fairly large presence in this business park, but I can&#8217;t for the life of me remember their name. Oh, wait, yes. I remember:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2536/5799103924_e8db3349eb.jpg"></p>

<p>When in doubt, follow the street signs. While I&#8217;m sure it is helpful to have signs pointing to <em>stuff</em> (other examples in this estate include &#8220;movies&#8221; and &#8220;amphitheatre&#8221;) hanging above the road, making them indistinguishable from street signs is bloody confusing, in my opinion.</p>

<p>Google is, of course, the whole reason I&#8217;m in this town, and in fact in this country for these two weeks. For the record, I was recruited via LinkedIn, so it definitely does have it&#8217;s uses. One of the reasons for this wander was to get a general idea of the lay of the land surrounding the Googleplex. My overall opinion: it&#8217;s big. Luckily, the Google bikes were very much in evidence:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5302/5798555777_9a73976a1c.jpg"></p>

<p>Often being found looking slightly forlorn in the strangest places. I&#8217;m fairly sure the local teens play a bit of cat and mouse with security guards and joyride around the park on them at weekends. This one was close to one of the volleyball courts:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5276/5799104166_5e5af56a28.jpg"></p>

<p>There actually is a reasonable amount to see, wandering around the campus. Google really does live up to a lot of its hype. One of the more famous landmarks of the campus was actually bloody difficult to find, though. It took a serious amount of detective work, comparing photos from the web to views from Google Maps, but I finally tracked down the &#8220;Android Lawn&#8221;:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2158/5798559713_a16b044a86.jpg"></p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3533/5798559919_da0f44242b.jpg"></p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2757/5798560063_64d6567a61.jpg"></p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2016/5798560409_d1608f766e.jpg"></p>

<p>As it turned out, if I&#8217;d just stood up and looked over my right shoulder from the place I was performing all of this furious Googling, I probably would have just spotted the damn thing. Such is life. Strangely enough, I was feeling a little hungry at this point, so I headed home.</p>

<p>Finally, it is important to note that while all of this touristing around is fun, and Google is a fuzzy and well meaning company, you should never forget that these are serious guys, doing a serious job. One most always strive to live up to the standard set by those who come before you, and always act in a professional and responsible manner when surrounded by such a high caliber of people.</p>

<p>Seriousness. Responsibility. Decorum.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3543/5799108082_ceb1e2603d.jpg"></p>

<p>That is all.</p>

    <link href="http://www.harveynick.com/blog/2011/06/03/the-process-and-the-platform/"/>
    <updated>2011-06-03T05:24:55+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.harveynick.com/blog/2011/06/03/the-process-and-the-platform</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The effort required to actually publish that <a href="http://harveynick.wordpress.com/2011/06/03/in-which-i-go-full-nerd-2/">last post</a> was&#8230; considerable. Several factors contributed to this:</p>

<ul>
<li>I have slow internet access at my hotel;</li>
<li>Currently, my only (full) computer is my work laptop;</li>
<li>This doesn&#8217;t have iPhoto installed (this is mostly for reasons of simplicity, I&#8217;d probably get it if I asked).</li>
</ul>


<p>In the end, I wrote the text of the post in Evernote on my iPad (using an external keyboard), since I&#8217;m supposed to install an absolute minimum of third party software on the laptop. Next, I did a copy paste into BlogPress, a blogging app which lets you insert images inline. In theory the official WordPress app also does this, except that the upload always fails for me. As you may have gathered, I inserted the images here. This also rescales them, so you don&#8217;t need to upload all 12 megapixels. Next, I uploaded it to my actual blog as a draft, and used the web interface to fix any formatting errors and add any extra formatting, since BlogPress doesn&#8217;t allow bold or italic text (that I&#8217;ve found). That done, I hit the publish button, and: presto!</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Needless to say, this is not an ideal workflow. I like using Evernote for writing the actual text (on both iPad and Mac) because it has about the right amount of functionality and it backs everything up and synchronises it between all of my devices. I like having that always available record which I can look back over and search as I see fit. I also like being able to drop one device, pick up another and keep working on the same document more or less seamlessly.</p>

<p>Digression: I also like that I can use it as a permanent record of my notes. Before I moved down to London I was part way through scanning my notebooks from my PhD into Evernote. Evernote runs OCR on the images, finds the text (when my handwriting makes this feasible) and make it searchable. Brilliant. It&#8217;s like being able to carry all of my old note books around with me, all of the time.</p>

<p>What Evernote doesn&#8217;t allow you to do is freely mix text and images, however. The WordPress interface does (obviously), but that leaves me with the problem of uploading the images. This is where the low bandwidth and lack of iPhoto were became problems. I suspect the cleanest workflow would be to immediately upload an album to Flickr (or other photo sharing site) and then use the appropriate URL to include the image in the blog post. Searching through the iPhoto library manually sure as hell isn&#8217;t ideal, and that&#8217;s the only real option for doing it image by image in the web interface.</p>

<p>The most pleasant experience I&#8217;ve had for putting together blog posts with both text and pictures was actually iWeb, and by a metric mile. iWeb uses the built in OSX controls and lets you select images according to meta-data and what they look like, rather than their file name, as though you were working with a file system specifically designed for serving you images. The iPad does more or less the same thing, in fact, so that part wasn&#8217;t actually too bad. Using iWeb leaves you with very limited options for your blog, however. It&#8217;s made me think I should look at using a dedicated program, such as <a href="http://www.red-sweater.com/marsedit/">MarsEdit</a>, for writing my posts, or at least for the final stages.</p>

<p>Ideally, I need to find a decent workflow, which doesn&#8217;t break down when I&#8217;m away from home and likely to actually have semi interesting things to blog about, but doesn&#8217;t restrict me when I am at home. Ideally, it should allow me to jump between different machines with a minimum of effort, and not require me  to always add the final touches from the same machine. The workflow should also not break down when no internet connection is available. Text is fairly easy. Images make things more difficult, especially if the images were recorded using my own camera.</p>

<p>Lastly, I&#8217;m giving some consideration to porting this blog over to Blogger (only if I can transfer all of my posts and comments, however). It&#8217;s not a coincidence that I now work for the company responsible for Blogger&#8217;s infrastructure. Becoming more familiar with that platform can only really be a good thing for me here. Blogger also gives me a couple of options which WordPress doesn&#8217;t, though. Thoughts?</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Jet lag is a funny thing. Right now it actually seems to be working in my favour; it&#8217;s managed to knock a couple of bad habits out of me. Specifically, these happen to be the not entirely unrelated habits of going to bed too late (then making it later by reading for a good long while) and getting up too late. Right now I seem to be fighting to keep my eyes open by around nine, and then being wide awake by seven. Which is more or less the position I found myself in on Sunday. Since day one at Google camp was a couple of days away I thought I&#8217;d check out my immediate surroundings.</p>

<p>This may come as a bit of a surprise to you, but there isn&#8217;t actually a lot to do in Mountain View. One of the things there is to do, however, is the computer history museum, which I&#8217;d been told is exactly as awesome as it sounds. In case my meaning isn&#8217;t clear: really awesome. There is no sarcasm here. Look at my face. Awesome. This is not my sarcastic face. Awesome. Face. Awesome.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>I have a rental car, but the brakes scare the shit out of me, and the place didn&#8217;t look too far away, so I decided to walk. Now, I&#8217;d been warned that no one walks in America, but I wasn&#8217;t quite prepared for it to be true. I must have walked 5 miles on Sunday and saw a grand total of perhaps 3 other pedestrians, and found that drivers looked at me as though I was a crazy person. I think perhaps one reason for this might be that the pavements (or sidewalks, if you like) are&#8230; well&#8230; shit. Anytime you have a height difference of more than an inch between two slabs&#8230; that&#8217;s bad.</p>

<p>Slightly thankful that there were no other pedestrians to see me trip, I arrived at the building in question. Externally, it&#8217;s kind of neat. You might mistake it for the headquarters of some hip new tech startup. If it wasn&#8217;t for the big sign saying &#8220;Computer history Museum&#8221; outside, obviously. Inside, though, it reminded me quite of bit of the Science Museum (&#8220;which science museum?&#8221; &#8220;The Science Museum&#8221;). It&#8217;s nowhere near as grandiose, and has a much narrower focus, but the comparison feels apt.</p>

<p><a href="http://harveynick.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/e01ff01b-d1b9-454d-afd7-cbc96bdfc9ed6.jpg"><img class="center" src="http://harveynick.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/e01ff01b-d1b9-454d-afd7-cbc96bdfc9ed6.jpg"><!-- header_img http://harveynick.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/e01ff01b-d1b9-454d-afd7-cbc96bdfc9ed6.jpg --></a></p>

<p>The scope of the exhibits is quite impressive, starting with slide rules and abaci, moving though Babbage (oh, I&#8217;ll come back to Babbage), on to Turing and right up to the present day. Here are a couple of examples of things which made me smile:</p>

<p><a href="http://harveynick.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/ab03b781-9c94-46de-851f-711679d9a0e90.jpg"><img class="center" src="http://harveynick.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/ab03b781-9c94-46de-851f-711679d9a0e90.jpg"></a></p>

<p>The Altair 8800, quite an important machine in the history of Microsoft, of which the fictionalised version of Steve Jobs in Pirates of Silicon Valley says &#8220;I never had any problem with the Altair&#8230; until I tried to use it.&#8221;</p>

<p><a href="http://harveynick.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/b17fcbeb-6b46-46e5-93f7-91c5995b999d1.jpg"><img class="center" src="http://harveynick.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/b17fcbeb-6b46-46e5-93f7-91c5995b999d1.jpg"></a></p>

<p>You know what&#8217;s better than that, though? A computer made out of wood. If you bought an <em>Apple I</em> you received a box of parts and some schematics. You hade to supply the case yourself. You know what else is awesome? UNIX is awesome:</p>

<p><a href="http://harveynick.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/11d69f5d-3b06-4df6-bc7a-0b85aaf6ca362.jpg"><img class="center" src="http://harveynick.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/11d69f5d-3b06-4df6-bc7a-0b85aaf6ca362.jpg"></a></p>

<p>You see? There&#8217;s a badge and everything. What says awesome more than a badge? Oh wait, I know:</p>

<p><a href="http://harveynick.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/7a115add-1257-44eb-9fa7-6dc114378d8f3.jpg"><img class="center" src="http://harveynick.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/7a115add-1257-44eb-9fa7-6dc114378d8f3.jpg"></a></p>

<p>Oh yeah. That&#8217;s right. I bet you wish you were cool enough to have that licence plate. As a side note: I wonder if anyone does have that licence plate, since I assume this one isn&#8217;t real. Furthermore: what kind of car would you put that on? This is fodder for <em>Pimp My Ride</em> right here. They should get on that (&#8220;Yo, we heard you like UNIX&#8230;&#8221;).</p>

<p>There was a lot more at the museum. Too much, in fact. I arrived about an hour after it opened and literally left as they locked the door behind me. I probably skipped about half of the section on the internet, and only had time for a brief look at the exhibit on the history of computer chess. Did I mention that they have half of Deep Blue? They also have something else very, very cool, and that&#8217;s one of the two Babbage <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Difference_engine">Difference Engines</a> which we only very recently developed the capability to actually build:</p>

<p><a href="http://harveynick.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/a677c6d3-c432-4285-9d81-1085791eeed14.jpg"><img class="center" src="http://harveynick.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/a677c6d3-c432-4285-9d81-1085791eeed14.jpg"></a></p>

<p>You really can&#8217;t do justice to this thing in a photograph. It&#8217;s beautiful. A marvel of engineering, it actually works exactly as Babbage said it would, and he built it entirely on paper. In 1849. Somebody should build an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_engine">Analytical Engine</a>. That, my friends, would truly be something.</p>

<p>One last thing:</p>

<p><a href="http://harveynick.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/c4843570-b8d8-4251-bf11-2e49bc097e955.jpg"><img class="center" src="http://harveynick.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/c4843570-b8d8-4251-bf11-2e49bc097e955.jpg"></a></p>

<p>I think this might be THE teapot.</p>

<p>Update: <a href="http://www.plan28.org/">Someone</a> is building an analytical engine!</p>

<p>Another update: there is a follow up post <a href="http://www.harveynick.com/blog/2011/06/06/full-nerd-ii-nerd-harder/">here</a>.</p>
