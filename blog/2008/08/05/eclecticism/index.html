<div class="entry-content"><p>Seems the Facebook app does not do what it&#8217;s supposed to. Never mind, I shall content myself with the (better) Wordpress interface. Maybe I&#8217;ll look into writing a Facebook app which interfaces with my RSS feed. That would be cool.</p>

<p>I thought I would write a music related post, since I found a couple of things on YouTube which piqued my interest. First an entirely serious one:</p>

<p>[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIhJC2-UNZA]</p>

<p>When I first heard this on the radio I thought it sounded so fresh they must be a new band. But no, they&#8217;ve been around quite a while, I even knew other songs by them. Unfortunately I don&#8217;t like many of them, but you can&#8217;t have everything. Apparently.</p>

<p>Next, something quite different. Helen played me this at a dinner party on Saturday night for the comedy value. I went looking for it on YouTube, mostly out of curiosity regarding the identity of the female singer, and found a live version. Promise me you&#8217;ll listen to at least some of it, and not just hit stop as soon as the guitars start. It might make you smile.</p>

<p>[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAR4ieUrxUM]</p>

<p>I think I genuinely like this. It helps that I actually like ABBA. I think they wrote really good songs. I also love cross genre covers, and this is definitely that. The female singer&#8217;s voice really works for me as well. I had a look for some of their other stuff, but it&#8217;s really not good, not good at all. It seems they split and formed two entirely new bands, both of which are a slight improvement, though.</p>

<p>Told you I had eclectic taste. Here are a couple more for your edification:</p>

<p>[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyZqpRxnHWg]</p>

<p>A soft one to start off with. Dido is so much better live. In my opinion her voice is perfect, but sounds overly processed on her recordings.</p>

<p>[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgrMfRYCRgw]</p>

<p>Bit of a heavier one, there. This is about as heavy as my taste in music gets. I love the singer&#8217;s voice, though. If you&#8217;re confused by this wait for the chorus. If you don&#8217;t have the pertinence for that, try this one by the same band:</p>

<p>[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAfRW_RMK4M]</p>

<p>See? The band, if you&#8217;re interested, are called &#8220;In Flames&#8221;. Look up a song called &#8220;Dead End&#8221; if you want to know what happens when a Swedish metal (death metal? pop metal? disco metal? death pop disco metal?) band collaborates with a Swedish pop singer song writer&#8230;</p>

<p>How about another soft one? Okay, but I&#8217;m going to get it from an unexpected place:</p>

<p>[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Waw61eE9FyY]</p>

<p>Yes, that was Slipknot. Bet you didn&#8217;t see that coming.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll skew a bit heavier again, but not too far.</p>

<p>[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiHBiRRB1Mw]</p>

<p>I&#8217;m a little disappointed that YouTube couldn&#8217;t supply &#8220;Father&#8217;s Daughter&#8221; from &#8220;Like a Bolt of Lightning&#8221;, but this will do.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m tempted to throw in a bit of Massive Attack, a bit of Evanescence, a bit of Killswitch Engage&#8230; but this post really could go on for ever, so I&#8217;ll stop it here.</p>
