    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Okay, so here&rsquo;s the formula:</p>

<pre><code>(A - B) + C = D
</code></pre>

<p>And here are the variables:</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>A = <iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/UZjf9C6atT4" width="" height="" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p>Evanescence. More specifically: the original line up (as far as most of the world is concerned). I like Evanescence quite a bit, but that&rsquo;s about 74.2% Amy Lee&rsquo;s voice. The girl has one hell of a pair of lungs on her. I picked this particular song from the first album for reason which may become obvious later. For what it&rsquo;s worth, I think Everybody&rsquo;s Fool and Imaginary are a much better songs.</p>

<p>B = <iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/bP5wmtOXCQ" width="" height="" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p>Evanescence again? No. Well&hellip; yes, but the current line up. Specifically: Amy Lee herself. I picked this song from the second album (which is much better than the first) because it seems to have the most Amy Lee-ness in it. It doesn&rsquo;t have an actual video, though, so alternatively:</p>

<p>B = <iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/Hqd2FJF8-h8" width="" height="" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p>I figure having a deficit of Seether won&rsquo;t affect the sum either way, so this works too.</p>

<p>C = <iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/dUyMvaJwACc" width="" height="" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p>Former Irish American Idol contestant* Carly Smithson. Once again: A hell of a pair of lungs. Not an entirely dissimilar look, but quite a different vocal style, it would appear. Carly&rsquo;s voice has a bit more blues in it, a bit more sultriness.</p>

<p>D = <iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/zzTZeeMCUBk" width="" height="" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p><a href="http://www.wearethefallen.com/">We are the Fallen</a>, the new band from Ben Moody, two other former members of Evanescence and Carly Smithson. Can you seen why I picked that particular Evanescence song? That&rsquo;s more than a passing resemblance, style wise. There is a second reason I picked it, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdYa0oeMLfI&amp;feature=related">however</a>. Carly has a less operatic voice, though, and a bit more range in terms of singing style. I love me some female fronted metal, so I&rsquo;ll be keeping an eye on this band.</p>

<p>Okay, here&rsquo;s another one which plays a bit better to her frankly spectacular voice:</p>

<p>D = <iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/u24NXTBHLYU" width="" height="" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p>* That is: she&rsquo;s Irish and was a contestant on &ldquo;American Idol.&rdquo; There is no such show as &ldquo;Irish American Idol,&rdquo; so far as I&rsquo;m aware.</p>
