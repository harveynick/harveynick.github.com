    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Helen&rsquo;s comment on my previous entry put me in mind of what I&rsquo;ve felt as the Scottish attitude towards England and the English more or less ever since I arrived here (seven years ago!). It goes something like this:</p>

<blockquote><p>The English? Bastards! We hate &lsquo;em! Oh, but we&rsquo;re not talking about you, of course. Dear me, no. More tea? Scone?</p></blockquote>

<!-- more -->


<p>I am generalising massively here, but it is the case that though I&rsquo;ve felt quite a bit of anti-English sentiment here (World Cup, anyone?), I&rsquo;ve met seldom few who&rsquo;ve had a problem with me because <em>I&rsquo;m </em>English. The exceptions are a drunk old man out side the Cameo cinema (that encounter proved to be too humerous a story for me to bear him any real ill will) and a couple of drunk guys in a shady night club. The later was two separate events, with both unfolding more or less exactly like this:</p>

<blockquote><p>Him: You&rsquo;re English.<br/>
Me: Yes.<br/>
Him: What the fuck are you doing in Scotland, then?<br/>
Me: I might be English, but I chose to live in Scotland.<br/>
Him: Aye&hellip; well&hellip; fair play to you, then.</p></blockquote>

<p>Quite a reasonable outcome, I thought. Things might have been different If I&rsquo;d said &ldquo;I&rsquo;m here for the football,&rdquo; or &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come to have sex with your family,&rdquo; though.</p>
