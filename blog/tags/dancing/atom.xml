    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>On Friday night I went to the Silent Disco and danced away until 4 am. On the whole I think it was excellent. I think it (or some progression of it) might well be the future of night clubs. It was £10 entry, which might seem a little expensive, but is really no more than the entry to a lot of clubs in Edinburgh. The music was also quite mainstream, and not the hardcore dance I was expecting, which is good because I think his sort of thing is a lot more fun when you can shout along with the words. Especially when you can take of your headphones and watch everyone dancing away without there being any apparent music.</p>

<p>Then on Saturday I drove through to Dunbar with Helen and Dougal to attend a ceilidh for our friend Matt's sister, who is leaving the country. What the hell was I doing there? I was invited mostly for my Y chromosome, since it was thought there would be a near overwhelming majority of female types present. This never in fact materialised, leaving me feeling that I was massively intruding (situations like this bring out the English in me to an alarming extent... I feel as though I can't say "please", "thank you" and of course "sorry" nearly enough). I had a really good time though, and enjoyed the dancing a lot... even though it's the only ceilidh I have clear memories of participating in. Luckily I had a good impromptu dance teacher and I don't think I embarrassed myself <em>too</em> much.</p>

<p>I stayed in Dunbar at Helen's parent's house on Saturday night and then went for long (well... more mid length) walk around the town the next morning, after a truly fantastic breakfast. Then I was invited to have lunch with Dougal and his parents, which was very pleasant. Still don't feel I said those three magical phrases enough at any of those places, but all in all it made for a most enjoyable weekend.</p>

<p>Yesterday, though, I woke up and could barely walk. I seem to have strained both my calves, which really isn't ideal. I suspect that I over used them during the weekend and know the muscles are trying to build themselves up. I have hyper-tense muscles in my legs (I think that's the phrase the physio used), which on the one hand sometimes means that they resemble steel cables (which is nice), but I can't even come close to touching my toes with my legs straight. I suspect this is a participating factor.</p>

<p>Ouch.</p>

<p>As a result of this I've been doing some work from home, as I suspect driving isn't such a great idea just now. I could catch the bus in to the University... but... well... I just don't want to. Writing up ahoy!</p>

<p>Here's a bit more Swedish music for you, this time of a much more melodic nature:</p>

<p>Nevertheless, this is the same singer who appears on "Dead End" by In Flames, which is from the exact opposite end of the musical spectrum.</p>
