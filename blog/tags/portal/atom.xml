<p>Mucho kudos to Dan Trachtenburg, Danielle Rayne, and everyone else envolved. No get back to it. I want more!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Two updates in one day shocker!</p>

<p>The last one was a little downcast, though, and I felt a need to pass on something awesome by way of balance. Here it is:</p>

<p>Perhaps you&rsquo;re thinking &ldquo;Huh? Who&rsquo;s this guy?&rdquo; or &ldquo;What&rsquo;s with the cake?&rdquo;. You&rsquo;ve been missing out if that&rsquo;s the case. Jonathan Coulton (for that is the man&rsquo;s name) is a computer programmer turned unlikely rock star (You scoff? He has a song in Rock Band. I&rsquo;m having trouble thinking of a better benchmark), who&rsquo;s become something of a geek standard thanks to the somewhat unlikely nature of his subject matter (one song has Pluto&rsquo;s moon singing its condolences regarding its loss of planet status).</p>

<p>The song itself is the song over the closing credits of the game Portal, which is, quite frankly, an absolute fucking work of art. You probably know that I&rsquo;m several different flavours of nerd and so JC&rsquo;s* stuff appeals to me on a fairly base level , but I&rsquo;m not a hardcore gamer. I have above average social skills, leave the house regularly and I prefer making love to playing computer games. There. I said it, and with a completely straight face. But that game is complete genius, through and through. I think Valve do amazing work in everything they do, and the fact they got JC* to write the song for the closing credits of one of their games makes me grin from ear to ear.</p>

<p>Check out some more of his stuff, it might make you smile. If you do and it does, leave a comment telling me about it, because that would make me smile**.</p>

<p>Update: His website is here <a href="http://www.jonathancoulton.com">http://www.jonathancoulton.com</a> And you can buy (and download for free) all his music there.<br/>
That is all.</p>

<p>* No, not <em>that</em> JC<br/>
** At the risk of me smiling so widely that the top of my head falls off.</p>
