    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of the few things I&rsquo;ve missed since abandoning the good ship Windows PC for the Mac&hellip; er&hellip; Zeppelin (why not?) is magazines. I used to really enjoy reading the PC gaming and hardware mags. Oftentimes they were pitched at about the right level for me. I felt neither patronised nor confused. I&rsquo;m afraid to say that this is not the case with Mac magazines. For the most part they tend to aim a little low, tech wise (no kidding, right?). I did also try Linux magazines, but generally found them to be way too dry and not especially well written. Once again, quelle surprise. Quelle surprise beaucoup.</p>

<p>So I was, as I&rsquo;m sure you can imagine, quite overjoyed to discover <a href="http://www.wired.co.uk/">Wired</a> magazine. A platform agnostic tech magazine pitched about the right level (ish) for me, tech wise, whilst also having some focus on the business side of technology? Win! If you&rsquo;re not reading it already, I highly recommend it. So, when Wired decided to give the cover story to location based social networks, concentrating on <a href="http://foursquare.com/">Foursquare</a> and <a href="http://gowalla.com/">Gowalla</a>, I though &ldquo;sure, what the hell?&rdquo; and gave them both a go.</p>

<p>That was a good couple of weeks ago now, and I can categorically say that I&rsquo;m not sure if I like them or not. Nor am I sure which of the two I prefer. The idea, basically, is that you periodically tell them where you are.</p>

<p>Where are you going? Wait, there&rsquo;s more.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a game of sorts, you see. Foursquare awards you points for visiting places (more if they&rsquo;re new places) while Gowalla gives you badges in your"passport.&ldquo; Both of them also award you bonuses for various things, and Foursquare declares you the "Mayor&rdquo; of locations if you visit them more than anybody else. There is a bit more to it than this, of course, there&rsquo;s a social aspect, connected to both locating your friends and finding out where is currently &ldquo;happening,&rdquo; (this is the correct term, yes?) but I think I&rsquo;ve given you the gist.</p>

<p>On balance: foursquare seems to do more in terms of the whole &ldquo;life as a game&rdquo; idea, and makes it feel more worthwhile to visit places multiple times&hellip; but Gowalla has a MUCH better design, and the badges and pins (achievements) it gives you are much prettier, but lacks the competitiveness of Foursquare. I think, at this point, I would tentatively recommend both, but particularly Foursquare if you&rsquo;re a competitive sort. Either way, feel free to friend me if you do give them a try (it&rsquo;s free).</p>
