    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A couple nuggets of knowledge came out of my &ldquo;You&rsquo;re Speaking My Language, Baby&rdquo; series of posts, so I though I&rsquo;d just take a quick moment to talk about them.</p>

<p>The first two are perhaps the most obvious by far. Firstly: if you actually write blog posts, people are more likely to read your blog. Funny that, huh? While my post on installing <a href="/blog/2008/08/24/mdl-celtx-on-the-acer-aspire-one/">Celtx on the Acer Aspire one</a> is still my most popular by some margin (probably because it actually provides some utility), I actually had my highest numbers of hits per day during the last week. Secondly: I get less hits over the weekend. Lax working habits for the win!</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s also interesting is the relative popularity of the individual parts of the series. Most popular first, it goes like this:</p>

<ol>
<li> Introduction</li>
<li> C++</li>
<li> Conclusion</li>
<li> Java</li>
<li> Objective-C</li>
</ol>


<p>Surround your pullquote like this {" text to be quoted "}</p>

<p>In one of those curious events the internet throws up, the writer of a blog I read on a regular basis also just started to work on a project of a potentially similar nature, and started off with some musings on which programming language to use. I&rsquo;m talking about Shamus Young in his <a href="http://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?p=9644">Twenty Sided</a> blog (I should really add it to my blog roll). Interestingly, and slightly comically, he came came to an equal and oposite conclusion to my own. He didn&rsquo;t consider Objective-C (not out loud, anyway), but decided that Java was the language to use if he wanted to produce something with commercial viability, but C++ was the language to use if he wanted to do some prototyping.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m still scratching my head at this in some ways. I don&rsquo;t care how much experience you have in C++, you&rsquo;re still likely to program faster in almost any language other than C. But in other ways it makes perfect sense. He has about a decade&rsquo;s worth of experience with C++ (likewise I have about ten years worth of Java under my belt), but only limited exposure to Java. He&rsquo;s looking at building a complete game, so he&rsquo;s being influenced by games like <a href="http://www.minecraft.net/">Minecraft</a> (which I will be talking about more later) which were successfully developed by an individual (in Java, as I understand it). If you&rsquo;re making something a bit niche and you don&rsquo;t have massive amounts of resources, then having a game which can be effortlessly ported to every major operating system is a good thing. You want to expand you potential audience as much as possible. Also, if your target demographic slants towards the nerd side of the spectrum then you don&rsquo;t want count out Linux, nor OSX (which gets more nerd love than you might expect). Having your game be able to run out of a browser doesn&rsquo;t hurt, either.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not (at this point) looking at building a complete game, but a piece of technology which could potentially be used by multiple games, though. Something of the order of a physics engine. Middleware is the term I seem to hear used. Thus Java (which I have more experience with) is my prototyping language, but C++ makes sense as an eventual target.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been holding back on what I&rsquo;m actually doing, but I essentially outed myself when I said it was similar to what Shamus is. So: I&rsquo;m doing something connected to procedural content generation. I&rsquo;ll explain more about what that means as I go along.</p>

<p>In other news I have two weeks off work. Seems I haven&rsquo;t used the vast majority of my holidays this year and taking the entire month of December off is not considered to be ideal. Thus: I have two weeks to do with as I please. I may visit my parents or even some of my friends down south. I&rsquo;ll also spend quite a bit of time sitting in coffee shops with a book and a note pad. Coffee shops are good places to think, I find. Just the right amount of bussle. I&rsquo;m also going to crack on with Clockwork Aphid. I&rsquo;m tinkering with some implementation details at the moment, but I plan on writing about what I have so far as well. I&rsquo;m also hoping to make the Heston Blumenthal chilli con carne I mentioned in a <a href="/blog/2010/08/24/its-hestontastic/">previous post</a>, but there are complications. Firstly, he&rsquo;s quite specific about the types of chilli powder you should use and some only seem to be available from the good ol' USA. They&rsquo;re on order, so hopefully they&rsquo;ll arrive fairly soon. Secondly, there&rsquo;s clearly a mistake in the recipe, unless Heston want me to boil a pan of water and prepare a bowl of ice water for purely ornamental purposes. This isn&rsquo;t completely outside the bounds of reason.</p>

<p>More updates soon. Look to the skies!</p>
