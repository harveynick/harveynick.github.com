<div class="entry-content"><p>A couple nuggets of knowledge came out of my &#8220;You&#8217;re Speaking My Language, Baby&#8221; series of posts, so I though I&#8217;d just take a quick moment to talk about them.</p>

<p>The first two are perhaps the most obvious by far. Firstly: if you actually write blog posts, people are more likely to read your blog. Funny that, huh? While my post on installing <a href="/blog/2008/08/24/mdl-celtx-on-the-acer-aspire-one/">Celtx on the Acer Aspire one</a> is still my most popular by some margin (probably because it actually provides some utility), I actually had my highest numbers of hits per day during the last week. Secondly: I get less hits over the weekend. Lax working habits for the win!</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>What&#8217;s also interesting is the relative popularity of the individual parts of the series. Most popular first, it goes like this:</p>

<ol>
<li>Introduction</li>
<li>C++</li>
<li>Conclusion</li>
<li>Java</li>
<li>Objective-C</li>
</ol>


<p><span class='pullquote-right' data-pullquote='when it comes to specifics, C++ gets the most interest'>
Now, my number of hits still isn&#8217;t exactly stellar, so this is a fairly small sample size, but it&#8217;s still quite interesting. People seem to be far more interested in reading about C++ than any of the other languages. In general, readers tend to want to know what it is I&#8217;m actually talking about, and what conclusion I come to, but when it comes to specifics, C++ gets the most interest. Is this a recommendation of the language, or the oposite, though? People could be reading what I say about it because they think it&#8217;s the sensible option&#8230; or because the folly of the language makes them seethe with rage. Hard to say. Perhaps I&#8217;ll look for some metrics of programming language popularity online.<br/>
</span></p>

<p>In one of those curious events the internet throws up, the writer of a blog I read on a regular basis also just started to work on a project of a potentially similar nature, and started off with some musings on which programming language to use. I&#8217;m talking about Shamus Young in his <a href="http://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?p=9644">Twenty Sided</a> blog (I should really add it to my blog roll). Interestingly, and slightly comically, he came came to an equal and oposite conclusion to my own. He didn&#8217;t consider Objective-C (not out loud, anyway), but decided that Java was the language to use if he wanted to produce something with commercial viability, but C++ was the language to use if he wanted to do some prototyping.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m still scratching my head at this in some ways. I don&#8217;t care how much experience you have in C++, you&#8217;re still likely to program faster in almost any language other than C. But in other ways it makes perfect sense. He has about a decade&#8217;s worth of experience with C++ (likewise I have about ten years worth of Java under my belt), but only limited exposure to Java. He&#8217;s looking at building a complete game, so he&#8217;s being influenced by games like <a href="http://www.minecraft.net/">Minecraft</a> (which I will be talking about more later) which were successfully developed by an individual (in Java, as I understand it). If you&#8217;re making something a bit niche and you don&#8217;t have massive amounts of resources, then having a game which can be effortlessly ported to every major operating system is a good thing. You want to expand you potential audience as much as possible. Also, if your target demographic slants towards the nerd side of the spectrum then you don&#8217;t want count out Linux, nor OSX (which gets more nerd love than you might expect). Having your game be able to run out of a browser doesn&#8217;t hurt, either.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not (at this point) looking at building a complete game, but a piece of technology which could potentially be used by multiple games, though. Something of the order of a physics engine. Middleware is the term I seem to hear used. Thus Java (which I have more experience with) is my prototyping language, but C++ makes sense as an eventual target.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been holding back on what I&#8217;m actually doing, but I essentially outed myself when I said it was similar to what Shamus is. So: I&#8217;m doing something connected to procedural content generation. I&#8217;ll explain more about what that means as I go along.</p>

<p>In other news I have two weeks off work. Seems I haven&#8217;t used the vast majority of my holidays this year and taking the entire month of December off is not considered to be ideal. Thus: I have two weeks to do with as I please. I may visit my parents or even some of my friends down south. I&#8217;ll also spend quite a bit of time sitting in coffee shops with a book and a note pad. Coffee shops are good places to think, I find. Just the right amount of bussle. I&#8217;m also going to crack on with Clockwork Aphid. I&#8217;m tinkering with some implementation details at the moment, but I plan on writing about what I have so far as well. I&#8217;m also hoping to make the Heston Blumenthal chilli con carne I mentioned in a <a href="/blog/2010/08/24/its-hestontastic/">previous post</a>, but there are complications. Firstly, he&#8217;s quite specific about the types of chilli powder you should use and some only seem to be available from the good ol&#8217; USA. They&#8217;re on order, so hopefully they&#8217;ll arrive fairly soon. Secondly, there&#8217;s clearly a mistake in the recipe, unless Heston want me to boil a pan of water and prepare a bowl of ice water for purely ornamental purposes. This isn&#8217;t completely outside the bounds of reason.</p>

<p>More updates soon. Look to the skies!</p>
