    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When I decided to drag myself back on to the fitness wagon, it seemed to me that running was the answer. Getting myself to an actual gym clearly wasn't working, but I lived a short walk from a large and beautiful park (oh The Meadows, how I miss you still). I went out and spent what I still consider to be a fair amount of money on a pair of running shoes (Nike+ compatible, obviously). I've had knee issues in the past, which motivated me to err towards the top end of the range, I swear. The presence of the striking red headed shop assistant with her beautiful blue eyes and athletic physique had absolutely nothing to do with my decision.</p>

<p>What was I talking about? Running! Right.</p>

<!-- More -->


<p><img class="center" src="/images/blog/2013/04/07/P1000436.JPG"><!-- header_img /images/blog/2013/04/07/P1000436.JPG --></p>

<p>Thusly equipped, I began striking out in the evenings and doing mixed running and walking intervals. Given my complete lack of a plan, I decided to work my way around the Meadows' sign posted mile long circuit, alternately running and walking the segments. After a couple of sessions of this, a few things become clear:</p>

<ul>
<li>I had absolutely no idea what sort of progress I was making. I was gathering no data;</li>
<li>I could only make fairly rough guesses at my actual pace;</li>
<li>I had no plan for how to increase the difficulty of my runs;</li>
<li>I wasn't having any fun. No data equals no graphs. No Graphs equals no fun. Obviously.</li>
</ul>


<p>As luck would have it, it was around that time when I stumbled across an ArsTecnica <a href="http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2009/11/reader-favorites-fitness-tech/">article which mentioned RunKeeper</a>, a combination of a website and (at the time) iPhone app which could be used to plan and track your runs. It would draw your route on a map, and draw all manner graphs of the data you generated. My. Oh. My.</p>

<p>Also mentioned in the review was the <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/c25k/Pages/couch-to-5k-plan.aspx">Couch to 5K program</a>, an NHS approved to program to take you from doing no running at all to being able to run 5K in one session over a period of several weeks, with a particular focus on preventing you getting either a) injured or b) bored. Seemed like a plan. I didn't want to be either of those things.</p>

<p>Like any good nerd I didn't go right out and sign up with RunKeeper, but spent a good long while reading reviews of other apps, some of which were C25K specific. RunKeeper won out in the end, though, and I started following the program during my lunch breaks (much more manageable than the evenings if you live in Scotland and don't want to run in the dark). Then the thing I'd been waiting over a year for happened. I got on a plane to Australia to support <a href="http://www.unmanned.co.uk/unmanned-vehicles-news/unmanned-autonomous-underwater-vehicles-uuv-auv-news/seebyte-breaks-record-with-gavia-auv/">Fugro's first foray into autonomous pipeline tracking</a>.</p>

<p>Now I was in Perth (the warm one) with a fair amount of spare time on my hands. Sometimes running around Edinburgh could be a serious chore. Even in summer it's not exactly warm a lot of the time and often times it's a bit on the rainy side. Perth was something else altogether, however. I'd chosen to stay in a small motel in the west of the city because:</p>

<ul>
<li>It was close to where I would be doing my work in the first phase of the job, so my commute would be short;</li>
<li>It was much cheaper than the more central hotels my company would normally have used, so I could spend more of the budget on food.</li>
</ul>


<p>Somehow, the thing which I hadn't factored into my planning was that the motel was also about a minute's walk from the coast road. That was a nice surprise, I can tell you. A long, helpfully flat, road with a minimum of interruptions which winds around a beautiful beach… and, oh yeah, looks sort of like this around sunset:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/blog/2013/04/07/P1000203.JPG"></p>

<p>Let me tell you: running under these circumstances is not a chore. Don't get me wrong: generally speaking it's something I like having done, rather than something I actually like doing. But these are pretty ideal circumstances. While waiting for the operations to actually get into gear (a common theme with any work in this field) a managed to get in a fair few runs.</p>

<p>I'll tell you what's not ideal for running, though: getting sent to Karratha, a baking hot oil and gas company town in the North of Western Australia, which unlike Perth has a lot of really small things which can kill you really, really quickly. Quickly <em>and</em> painfully.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/blog/2013/04/07/DSC01052.JPG"></p>

<p>Even less ideal is actually being sent offshore and spending a week or so floating on a small boat. Less ideal still is if that boat turns out to be a catamaran, and this is how you find out that catamarans make you very, very seasick. I'd worked offshore previously and even in bad weather, so I swear I'm not usually that much of a delicate flower when it comes to a bit of pitch and roll… but the evidence doesn't lie. I've never spent more time hugging either a railing or a toilet bowl than I did on that trip. Try working a laptop under <em>those</em> circumstances. But I digress...</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/blog/2013/04/07/DSC00889.JPG"></p>

<p>The final nail in the coffin of this crack at C25K was actually arriving back in Edinburgh and finding that in summer the weather was far less clement that Perth's winter climate. Going outside and running just plain wasn't something I had the will for.</p>

<p>I don't want to be too unfair to Edinburgh, though. I mean, Perth doesn't have any of this:</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>During most of university I was in pretty crap shape, but in the second year of my PhD my physical condition got particularly lousy. I caught a bus every morning which left from directly outside my flat and took me directly to the university. I did pretty much no exercise and ate an awful lot of takeaway. A few of my friends remarked that I'd gained weight. "Don't worry," they said "it's fine," in response to my mortified expression, I'm sure "You look well with it". But I knew I looked nothing of the sort.  To paraphrase Eddie Izzard: when I looked in the mirror I sure as hell didn't want to have sex with myself.</p>

<!-- More -->


<p>Then, as part of the job which ran in tandem with my studies I spend a couple of weeks working offshore on a maintenance ship. Where there was pretty much nothing to do. A worked, I ate, I slept. I played my way through Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas. But I also started to make use of the small gym on board the ship. Every day at around the same time I would go down, use the rowing machine for a while, use the cross trainer for a bit, maybe fiddle with the pec deck or the lat pulldown machine. Basically: I had no idea what I was doing… but I knew I had to do something.</p>

<p>Back on dry land I signed up for a gym and was given a workout program as part of a complementary training session. I told the trainer I wanted to use the machines and not the free weights, basically because I thought the guys who used the free weights were a bit douchey (based on the evidence I'd seen on the ship and the one time I'd visited the university gym). So for a year or two I diligently hit the gym three evenings a week and gradually increased the amount of weight I was moving around. Equally gradually I also started to like what I was seeing in the mirror.</p>

<p>It didn't last, though. My circumstances changed and I found myself working full time in a different part of the city, while also needing to finish writing my thesis. Getting to the gym in the evenings was now a lot harder… and so started to not happen. I fell back into bad habits and put back on a lot of the weight I'd lost.</p>

<p>I kept trying to get back on the wagon. Twice I started <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/c25k/Pages/couch-to-5k-plan.aspx">Couch to 5k</a>, and twice I failed to make it all the way through. The first, ironically, because I was sent to work offshore again in my previous job, and then my second attempt was scuppered by a foot injury. Every once in a while I would manage to drag myself to the work gym down here in London… but I didn't have any sort of a plan and I didn't really make any sort of progress.</p>

<p>Then it happened. This is the part of the story I'm very hesitant about discussing further. It's deeply personal. But it's also key.</p>

<p>I found myself in a rather fantastic situation with a very attractive member of the opposite sex. One I'd wanted to be in for some time. It was, as I'm sure you can imagine, a very positive experience. But it was also mortifying, because I found myself looking at this gorgeous lady and realizing how hard I was trying <em>not</em> to look at myself. The contrast between us was, to me, quite shocking. It was then that I thought to myself (and yes, I'm aware of the cliche) "I have to get myself in shape" and this time I rally, really meant it.</p>

<p>What happened next? Well… fitness wise I got really geeky about it. Really geeky indeed. I'll talk about it more in a different post, but I will say this: I'm definitely making progress, much more successfully than I every did before. Project "look good naked" is in effect, and I'm bringing the technologies.</p>

    <id>http://www.harveynick.com/blog/2013/03/25/categories-and-goals</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It's good to have goals. Even if you fail to meet them. Sometimes especially when you fail to meet them. It's quite widely publicized that at Google we're expected to score 0.7 (on a scale where 0 is a complete failure and 1 means all targets were met) when assessing our OKRs (objectives and key results). Generally this is good. It means you're always striving, always raising your eyes, hitting the top of the tree by aiming for the sky.</p>

<p>In my personal life, though, this probably isn't the best approach. Be that as it may, this year I have goals.</p>

<!-- More -->


<p>1. Get myself in shape.</p>

<p>Also known as: project "look good naked". There's a bit more to it than this, of course. There's also a bit of a story behind it, which I'll probably tell in a later post. I also have some ideas around this area which might turn into something else. If I'm going to set goals, I need a way to measure success, after all.</p>

<p>Talking about this here leaves me with a slightly odd problem, though. When I relaunched this blog I adjusted all of my category names to be descriptive nouns, which means a can auto-generate the part of the about text (on the right) which references them. I don't know what the appropriate noun is for someone who participates in and thinks about fitness related activities. This is a stupid problem to have, but it is a problem, nevertheless.</p>

<p>2. Get my House in order.</p>

<p>In the literal sense. One of the reasons things went dark on this blog last year is that I actually took the plunge and bought a flat. This ate a lot of my time and left my life in a bit of an inconsistent state for a month or so. Now I'm in, though, and having spent a winter in the place I've taken stock. It needs some work. It needs to be warmer when the weather is cold. It needs a bit more personality… and some of the really odd design decisions made by the previous owners need to be reversed.</p>

<p>It's also a whole new playground for me to seek adventures in. My Clockwork Aphid project was a casualty of the upheaval in my life last year and I'm not sure how much attention it'll get this year… because this year I'd also like to start playing with home automation. Nothing crazy. No robot butlers; but we'll see.</p>

<p>3. Read. Travel. Watch. Write.</p>

<p>This one is more straight forward. I'd like to start more closely measuring how much a read, travel, watch (mainly in terms of films) and write, on this blog an elsewhere.</p>

<p>Reading is straightforward, I think. I read a lot. On my way to work, before bed, in coffee shops at the weekend, But I'm curious to try and keep tabs on what I'm reading and how much. It frustrates the hell out of me that my kindle can't easily supply me with the information.</p>

<p>One of my friends has a goal for this year that she will get out of Edinburgh at least once every month. That's not a bad goal to have at all. For me, I'd just like to see and experience more of the wider world in general, but also the part of it which I inhabit.</p>

<p>As for watching films and keeping tabs on what I saw… well… I already have <a href="http://ohsohumbleopinion.tumblr.com">a place to keep tabs on that</a>. Simple. This is mostly a matter of "keep it up".</p>

<p>Lastly: writing. Er… yes. I don't have such a great record with this one. Obviously I want to get back to posting regularly on this blog… but I'd also like to try and do something with the two screenplays I wrote during university (and the pile of partially developed ones). I used to regularly do some sort of creative writing and lately I'm starting to feel the lack of it in my life.</p>
