    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I haven't blogged in some, so it seemed only natural that I should do the churlish thing and write about items I would like, but do not have, post Christmas.</p>

<p>First of all is a pod based coffee maker. When walking through House of Fraiser pre Christmas my beautiful and wonderful girlfriend had cause to exclaim "These are so cool*!" What she was talking about was a Nespresso machine (or more precisely a table full of them). Basically you pop a little pod of coffee in the top, push a button and really quite good espresso (or something a lot like it) comes out of the spout. Boom. Simple and fast, without any fuss or the need to do much in the way of cleaning. This appeals to me. A lot.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>There is of course a problem. The clue is in the name, and being the intelligent general reader you may have already spotted it. The whole shebang is made (or at least owned) by Nestle, who are are (by my own personal set of benchmarks) evil. Like, actually killing babies evil. They make all the coffee which can be used with the machines, meaning there is a limited selection, and have patented the design thoroughly enough that this will be the case for ever-more. So, refillable pods are not an option and the pre-filled ones are aluminium and only recycle-able in Switzerland. Unacceptable. Bugger.</p>

<p>So I did a bit of reading about the other pod based systems out there, and discounted almost all of them for one reason or another. It generally comes down to either evil companies or an unacceptable degree of waste. The one I didn't discount is the Senseo, which doesn't produce such good coffee (it has a 2 bar pump versus the nespresso's 19 bar), but you can buy refillable pods for it. Also, it's cheaper. A lot cheaper since Sainsbury has it on sale at half price. Problem solved. I'll probably pick one up tomorrow.</p>

<p>What I won't b picking up tomorrow is one of Sony's eBook readers. While I think they're completely awesome (eInk rules, I though it was actual paper when I first saw it and didn't even believe it was a screen until I saw it change) £350 is just too high an asking price. That's a lot of books. Check them out if you get the chance, though. One day, when its price goes down and mine goes up, I'll get myself one.</p>

<p>Lastly come the controversial one. Women carry bags. This is accepted. The size varies, though. I've seen at least one girl with a bag which, though clearly a handbag in terms of design, was about a metre long. Men on the other hand, are expected not to. If they do it is derisively referred to as a "Man Bag." Frankly, though, it's bloody useful. I tend to carry a messenger bag around a lot of the time as a result. It holds my tiny laptop, a notebook, some pens (duh), a reusable shopping bag and generally a book and some uni related things. The one I originally bought doesn't really measure up, though, in either form or function. What I'm looking for is something stylish on the outside, but nerd-tastically well organised on the inside. Stylish that is, again, by my own personal set of benchmarks. I kinda like <a href="http://www.caselogic.com/15_4_canvas_messenger_bag/product_detail/index.cfm?modelid=113539">this one</a>. Now, if I could only find somewhere that actually sells it...<br/>
 <br/>
* Even though she, in fact, does not drink coffee. No one, it seems, is perfect.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Dear Road User,</p>

<p>Should you be located in the UK and in possession of an automobile, you may have noticed a strange lever positioned to the left of your steering wheel (the circular device which changes the direction of your car). If you are of the inquisitive sort you may have also discovered a causal relationship (or at least a very strong correlation) between pushing this appendage in either of the upwards or downwards directions, and the flashing of two sets of orange lights positioned down the sides of your car.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>I'm here to assure you that this is a good thing and in no way the cause or result of black magic. The intention is that when you (the automobile operator) "turn" (to use the vernacular) you first activate one (but not both) of these sets of lights, thus apprising your fellow road users of your intentions. They would, of course, otherwise be forced to rely on telepathy. Telepathy is a dicey proposition at best, and one which should certainly not be attempted whilst simultaneously maneuvering around a ton of vehicular machinery. Contact of this sort with your cerebrum might also have the unfortunate side effect of causing them to "catch the stupid".</p>

<p>Do not forget: You are in Britain. To not follow these simple precautions is not just dangerous, worse, it is <em>rude</em>.</p>

<p>Best Regards,</p>

<p>Cursing your Existence, That Last Roundabout.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Helen's comment on my previous entry put me in mind of what I've felt as the Scottish attitude towards England and the English more or less ever since I arrived here (seven years ago!). It goes something like this:</p>

<blockquote><p>The English? Bastards! We hate 'em! Oh, but we're not talking about you, of course. Dear me, no. More tea? Scone?</p></blockquote>

<!-- more -->


<p>I am generalising massively here, but it is the case that though I've felt quite a bit of anti-English sentiment here (World Cup, anyone?), I've met seldom few who've had a problem with me because <em>I'm </em>English. The exceptions are a drunk old man out side the Cameo cinema (that encounter proved to be too humerous a story for me to bear him any real ill will) and a couple of drunk guys in a shady night club. The later was two separate events, with both unfolding more or less exactly like this:</p>

<p>Him: You're English.<br/>
Me: Yes.<br/>
Him: What the fuck are you doing in Scotland, then?<br/>
Me: I might be English, but I chose to live in Scotland.<br/>
Him: Aye... well... fair play to you, then.</p>

<p>Quite a reasonable outcome, I thought. Things might have been different If I'd said "I'm here for the football," or "I've come to have sex with your family," though.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So.</p>

<p>It's not that I feel that Bristol is an intrinsically bad or depressing place. My attitude to it was coloured by the fact that I was a little tired of travelling, tired in general and didn't entirely want to be there. Also, and this is the key fact, I'd just got back from Iceland. I liked Iceland a lot, despite the twelve hour days I felt almost no stress the entire I was there. There's something very chilled about the place, and there was almost no traffic congestion, even considering that we drove through the middle of Reykjavik every morning during hush hour. But there's something else.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>I talk quite a bit about how safe I feel in Edinburgh. I'll walk the length of the city at 3am, no problem. Not that this place is perfect. On my very first night we had to take a diversion on the way back from a night club to avoid a murder scene. But... the last time I tried to walking home after a few drinks back in Maltby a gang of around fifteen guys tried to start a fight with us, and then we had to hide out at a friend's house and get a lift home in case they were waiting for us further down the road. This wasn't even in a bad part of town, this was on High Street. Our actions weren't out of the ordinary, we were just following the drill. Do you get the picture?</p>

<p>It's not something I generally feel I have to worry about in Edinburgh, sasanach as I may be. In Reykjavik, though, we managed to... hhhmmm... how to phrase this without making myself and my colleague look like complete retards... nope... don't think it's possible... leave our belongings unguarded, unwatched and open to theft in an area of town, which, though out of the way, was frequented by the boy racer crowd. Nothing was stolen or even touched. The response we received to our astonishment regarding this: "Well, no... of course it wasn't." I didn't see a single person I would describe as a Ned or a Chav the entire time I was there. Apparently they're closing prisons <em>down</em>. It was nice.</p>

<p>Then I arrived in Bristol and found my self literally sounded by signs saying "Warning: bag snatchers operate in this area.", "Pickpockets operate in this area." and "Remove all valuables from your car."</p>

<p>That's what depressed me.</p>

<p>Enough of this talk, though! Here's some more Jonathon Coulton for you:</p>

<p><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4TnhemCEmc" width="" height="" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p>I really wish I had a girlfriend right now, ideally one who was also a programmer, so I could giver her <a href="http://www.cafepress.com/jonathancoulton.58539188">these</a>. I'd probably get my arse <em>kicked</em> for it, but damn it would make me laugh...</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I've been traveling around for work for the vast majority of the last month, so generally speaking I've been anything but at a loose end. Evenings were full of work or spent with the colleagues / friends I was traveling with. But now I'm back and finding that I don't know what to do with myself a lot of the time. It's giving me time to think about things, and that never ends well.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>I think my PhD is in better shape than I had been supposing. I found a couple of stupid mistakes in my code today and now it actually seems to be working quite well. With a bit of tweaking of settings it might produce valid, or even impressive, output. This is good. It means I can stick to my plan to only put in eight hour days at the lab (though I might do a bit of writing up at home). An eight hour days feels pretty short just now. Thus the stress levels may reduce. I've more or less been running on stress and adrenaline/caffeine for the last few months though, so once again: time and head space to think about things.</p>

<p>It's making me very uncertain about a lot of things. The financial market is clearly well up shit creak, and it ate its paddle some miles back. This also coincides with a financial meltdown of my own, precipitated by my funding running out and exacerbated by my purchase of a car. Yep, I reckon I'll look back on that one as a particularly retarded mistake in years to come. I've got things on a more or less stable footing now, but my long term security is... clouded... not what I'd like it to be... in a lot of respects.</p>

<p>I also find myself thinking about sex, love, friendship, their relationship to each other, and my relationship to each. Things I had, things I've lost, and things I want in the future. I'm not feeling quite introspective enough to textualise any of that just now, but you should probably be thankful for that.</p>

<p>These are indeed uncertain times.</p>

<p>I've also decided to try and get back into going to the gym. I've had no time for exercise in the last month and have probably been eating a little too well and it's stating to show. I went for the first time in what feels like an age last night, and, you know what, it felt pretty good. I've missed that post gym sensation of having actually done something and made my muscles (such as they are) work for a living.</p>

<p>I just looked out of the window. The sun is shining! Time to go out into it, I suspect!</p>
