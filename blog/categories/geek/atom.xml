    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As I promised in my <a href="blog/2013/05/06/do-you-even-lift/">last post</a>, I'd now like to talk a bit about the different weight lifting programs I ended up researching. I spent a fairly silly amount of time here, so I'm hoping that you find it useful.</p>

<p>I'm going to talk about the three primary beginners lifters programs I read up on, tell you what they actually involve… and also what I think the person behind them is trying to sell you.</p>

<p><span class='pullquote-right' data-pullquote='Disclaimer: I am not an expert on any of this.'>
<em>Disclaimer: I am not an expert on any of this. I am, at best, an amateaur of the sort who tends to read everything he can find about a subject which interests him (translation: a geek). You should consider the majority of what's written here to be opinion and look into these things yourself. I hope I can provide a good jumping off point, though.</em>
</span></p>

<p>Pretty much all the programs I've found centre around four barbell lifts. So I figured I'd start by quickly describing them:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Bench press.</em> You know what this one is. It's the one you saw in the montages of all those action movies. Lie with your back against the bench and lift the barbell from your nipples straight up until your arms are fully locked.</li>
<li><em>Shoulder press.</em> Stand with the barbell held approximately level with your shoulders, forearms vertical. Lift the bar directly upwards until your arms are fully locked. This has more nuance than it sounds.</li>
<li><em>Squat.</em> Stand with the bar braced across your shoulders, ideally resting on your lats. Drop down into a squatting position (duh) keeping your feet flat against the floor and pushing your knees apart. Stand, pushing up through your heels.</li>
<li><em>Deadlift.</em> I'm not going to try and explain this one. That's a lawsuit waiting to happen. Here's a video:</li>
</ul>


<p><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/Syt7A23YnpA" width="" height="" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p>Having thrown a Mark Ripptoe video in this post already, it seems only right that I start with…</p>

<h3>Starting Strength (SS)</h3>

<p>Starting Strength is essentially three things:</p>

<ul>
<li>A barbell lifting program for beginners;</li>
<li>A <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Starting-Strength-3rd-Mark-Rippetoe/dp/0982522738">book</a> which describes the lifts in the program in <em>incredible</em> biomechanical detail;</li>
<li>A series of seminars.</li>
</ul>


<p>The man behind all three of these is one Mark Ripptoe, whose dulcet tones guided you through the deadlift in the video above. Pretty obviously: he wants to sell you a copy of his book (though hard copies are <em>really</em> hard to come by) or possibly a ticket to a seminar. In fairness there is pretty much nothing else like the book out there. It might arguably be more detail than you need, but it's still seriously impressive.</p>

<p>"Rip" is also something of personality. There are <a href="http://startingstrength.wikia.com/wiki/Wit_and_Wisdom_of_Mark_Rippetoe">entire websites</a> dedicates to things he's said. Here's one which made me laugh:</p>

<p><blockquote><p>"I don't go to titty bars much anymore. They have never really appealed to me. Like going into an expensive restaurant, reading the menu for 2 hours, drinking a little, then getting up and leaving without having had anything to eat but paying the bill anyway."</p><footer><strong>Mark Ripptoe</strong> <cite><a href='http://startingstrength.wikia.com/wiki/Wit_and_Wisdom_of_Mark_Rippetoe'>startingstrength.wikia.com/wiki/&hellip;</a></cite></footer></blockquote></p>

<p>…and here's one which actually has something to do with what I'm supposed to be taking about here:</p>

<p><blockquote><p>"There is simply no other exercise, and certainly no machine, that produces the level of central nervous system activity, improved balance and coordination, skeletal loading and bone density enhancement, muscular stimulation and growth, connective tissue stress and strength, psychological demand and toughness, and overall systemic conditioning than the correctly performed full squat."</p><footer><strong>Mark Ripptoe</strong> <cite><a href='http://startingstrength.wikia.com/wiki/Wit_and_Wisdom_of_Mark_Rippetoe'>startingstrength.wikia.com/wiki/&hellip;</a></cite></footer></blockquote></p>

<p>I'm going to admit right away that there is more to the actual program than I originally thought there was. I'll describe what I've seen called the "core" program here, but you can find a more complete explanation over at the <a href="http://www.fitocracy.com/knowledge/official-starting-strength-guide-for-fitocrats/">Fitocracy knowledge base</a>.</p>

<p>Each lift in the program is preceded by a warm up, which is the case for ever lift in every program here, even if I don't mention it. You start with the empty bar* and then increase the weight in stages until you reach your work weight.</p>

<p>In the Starting Strength program** you work out Monday, Wednesday and Friday, performing three lifts each day. There are two workouts, which you rotate:</p>

<ul>
<li>Workout A: Squat 3x5, shoulder press 3x5, deadlift 1x5.</li>
<li>Workout B: Squat 3x5, bench press 3x5, power clean 5x3.</li>
</ul>


<p>"Rotate" means that your first week would look like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>Monday: Workout A</li>
<li>Wednesday: Workout B</li>
<li>Friday: Workout A</li>
</ul>


<p>...then your second week would look like so:</p>

<ul>
<li>Monday: Workout B</li>
<li>Wednesday: Workout A</li>
<li>Friday: Workout B</li>
</ul>


<p>...and so on.</p>

<p>Firstly, the numbers after each of the lifts are in the form &lt;sets>x&lt;repetitions>. Secondly, the sharp eyed amongst you will probably have noticed that I snuck an extra lift in there. So, what exactly is a power clean? Basically, it's like a deadlift… but you keep going, explosively lifting the weight up to your shoulders (though not above your head).</p>

<p>Generally speaking weights should be increased gradually after each successful workout, and not usually by more than 2.5kg (except perhaps for the deadlift). Again, see the link to the Fitrocracy knowledge base above for more details, but I would also be quite remiss if I did not mention <a href="http://startingstrength.com/">StartingStrength.com</a>.</p>

<p>Also: anytime you want to see a good demonstration of a barbell lift, try typing "Mark Ripptoe &lt;name of lift>" into YouTube. This is a man who knows what he's talking about.</p>

<h3>Strong Lifts 5x5 (SL)</h3>

<p><span class='pullquote-right' data-pullquote='This is the secret training program used by Arnold Schwarzenegger, apparently.'>
Strong Lifts 5x5 is very much a program from the internet. In fact, if you were to go <a href="http://stronglifts.com">stronglifts.com</a> there is a good chance that you might come away with the impression that Mehdi (the guy behind it) is trying to sell you snake oil. This is the secret training program used by Arnold Schwarzenegger, apparently. Ignore that, though, since insofar as I can tell this program is up there with SS for the amount respect it gets for a beginners program. Mehdi wants you to come to his website and make use of the resources there (which are actually pretty good), because he's monetized the site with ads. He would also like you to sign up for the paid "Strong lifts inner circle" members only community.
</span></p>

<p>SL is very similar in structure to SS in that it's the four main lifts plus one extra, with two alternating workouts each featuring three lifts to be performed on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. The two workouts look like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>Workout A: Squat 5x5, bench press 5x5, Pendley Row 5x5.</li>
<li>Workout B: Squat 5x5, shoulder press 5x5, deadlift 1x5.</li>
</ul>


<p>This time around the fifth lift is the bent over (or Pendley) row, which is basically the exact opposite of the bench press. Yes, this is exactly as awkward as it sounds and, like the deadlift, is a really good way to knacker your back if performed incorrectly. That being the case, I'll let the man Glen Pendley himself explain it to you rather than trying to do the job myself:</p>

<p><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/ZlRrIsoDpKg" width="" height="" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p>The other differences to SS are that with SL you perform five sets of five reps at your work weight (deadlift is again one set), and you you have a strictly defined methodology for increasing the weight of your lifts:</p>

<ul>
<li>If you hit five reps on all five sets you add 2.5kg the next time you do the lift (5kg for deadlift);</li>
<li>If you miss any reps, you stay at the same weight;</li>
<li>If you miss reps multiple times, you deload by 10% and then work your way back up.</li>
</ul>


<p>This is the program I originally started doing, largely because it was easier to find a strict definition of what the program actually <em>was</em> than was the case for SS. It worked pretty well for me in the beginning, but as you increase the weight you'll also tend to increase the rest between sets, so after a couple of months I just seemed to be spending forever in the gym. In the end I stopped doing the program to try working with an online trainer, which I might talk about some in a later post.</p>

<h3>Greyskull Linear Progression (GLP)</h3>

<p>Greyskull LP is the beginners lifting program used at the Greyskull Barbell Club on the East Coast of the USA and created by the club's owner, John Sheaffer aka "Johnny Pain", a former student of Mark Ripptoe (remember him?).</p>

<p>What Johnny Pain is trying to sell you is the idea that you might like to train at his gym, and failing that maybe one of his books, such as the very one which <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Greyskull-LP-Second-John-Sheaffer/dp/0615635571">describes the program</a>. You can also find one variation of the program described in some detail by the man himself on <a href="http://strengthvillain.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=9&amp;t=89#p376">the forums at StrengthVillain.com</a>, though not in anywhere near as much detail as in the book.</p>

<p>Side note about the book: I bought it. I think it's a really good resource and actually quite well written (I laughed out loud more than once), but perhaps not for the feint of heart. Dear old Johnny Pain can get a little bawdy, from time to time.</p>

<p>This is, again, very similar to Starting Strength, but with more of a focus on maintaining the linear progression for as long as possible. This is also a very flexible program, being made of a core program and a set of "plug-ins".</p>

<p>The core program is three days a week, again: Monday, Wednesday and Friday. For your first lift on each day, you alternate bench press and shoulder press. On Mondays and Fridays you then do squats. On Wednesdays: Deadlift. After warming up, you move on to three sets at your work weight. Again like SS, your first two sets are of five reps, however your third set is to failure (or as close to it as you're prepared to go), so basically as may reps as you can do, but at least five. The exception is the deadlift, for which you just perform a single set of as many reps as you can manage.</p>

<p>If you manage to hit at least 5 reps for each of your work sets, you increase the weight. 2.5kg for squat and deadlift, 1.25kg for bench and shoulder press. This last is actually quite tricky, since it involves using "fractional" plates, which most gyms don't carry and I, as yet, have not been able to find a good place to buy. If you fail to hit your five reps on each set you knock 10% off the weight for the next time (rounding down) and start working your way back up.</p>

<p><span class='pullquote-right' data-pullquote='Seeing that you can now do eights reps at a weight you could only manage five at before drives home that you have gotten stronger and are making progress.'>
The upshot of this is that firstly the relaxed pace (two main lifts a day and small increases in weight) means that you're much less likely to stall and so will continue the linear progression for longer. Secondly, doing the third set to failure mean that you'll build a little more muscle (hypertrophy) and also you'll tend to hit either a reps or weight personal best every time you lift. Deloading can be frustrating in that it feels like moving backwards. Seeing that you can now do eights reps at a weight you could only manage five at before drives home that you have gotten stronger and are making progress.
</span></p>

<p>Given the amount of time I've spent talking about it, you might have worked out that this is the program I'm actually following at the moment. I liked the more gradual approach to increasing the weight here, and I like the additional flexibility of the plug-ins, which I'll talk about in another post.</p>

<p>* Or as close as possible, clearly that isn't going to work for the conventional deadlift. If you <em>do</em> need to start at a lower weight, however, you can improvise by either propping the weights up on spare plates, or perform a <a href="http://www.bodybuilding.com/exercises/detail/view/name/romanian-deadlift">Romanian Deadlift</a> instead.</p>

<p>** Calling it the SS program seems… wrong.</p>

    <updated>2013-05-06T15:24:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.harveynick.com/blog/2013/05/06/do-you-even-lift</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After I arrived in London I decided to take a second stab at Couch to 5k, having abandoned it <a href="blog/2013/04/07/running-the-first-time/">the first time around</a>. The problem now was finding a time and place. At first I tried running in the evenings around Wandsworth Common, conveniently close to where I was staying. That started to feel more than a little unsafe, however, especially on the evenings I got home safe enough to push me through -twilight- dusk and into full dark. I'm fortunate enough to work very close to Hyde Park, however, so I transplanted my runs here and started taking time out of my work day. Running through Hyde Park in the sun is awesome, by the way.</p>

<p>All was fine and dandy until I fell off a surf board during a short break and cracked the top of my foot against the sea bed. I'd twisted myself into a slightly odd position in order to accomplishing this, and so it had the added bonus effect of pushing my foot much further back than it's really supposed to go. By the time I got back to London, my entire foot had turned a lovely combination of purple and yellow. Shit.</p>

<!-- More -->


<p>Needless to say, this put a fairly major obstacle in the way of any running that I might try to do, given that it really hurt to even walk. So, once again, the running stopped. In parallel to all of this, however, I'd spent some time clicking around the "connected apps" section on Run Keeper's website and found something called <a href="https://www.fitocracy.com">"Fitocracy"</a>. It was two things rolled into one:</p>

<ol>
<li>A fitness related social network;</li>
<li>A gamification system which awards points and achievements based on fitness activities performed.</li>
</ol>


<p><span class='pullquote-right' data-pullquote='Gamification works ridiculously well on my computer game addled brain.'>
Gamification works ridiculously well on my computer game addled brain. Scoring those points (and levelling up!) worked as an excellent motivator for me while I was running. When I signed up to the site I also joined the mailing list. Against all normal logic, some of those emails actually turned out to be quite interesting. A lot of them were member spotlights, and a lot of these members were talking about the fact that it was lifting weights, and not doing cardio, which got them into shape.

<p>I did some more reading and found myself pointed at <a href="http://reddit.com/r/fitness">/r/fitness</a>, where a lot of people were saying very similar things. Two workout programs were suggested for beginners, <a href="http://startingstrength.com/">Starting Strength</a> and <a href="http://stronglifts.com/">Strong Lifts 5x5</a>. Having made <a href="blog/2013/04/01/a-fitness-story/">the decision to get myself back in shape</a>, I decided I would have a go at one of these programs. As for which, why, and what they entail: that's actually post of its own, because there are actually a couple of other programs I want to talk about as well. Stay tuned.</p>

    <link href="http://www.harveynick.com/blog/2013/04/07/running-the-first-time/"/>
    <updated>2013-04-07T22:54:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.harveynick.com/blog/2013/04/07/running-the-first-time</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When I decided to drag myself back on to the fitness wagon, it seemed to me that running was the answer. Getting myself to an actual gym clearly wasn't working, but I lived a short walk from a large and beautiful park (oh The Meadows, how I miss you still). I went out and spent what I still consider to be a fair amount of money on a pair of running shoes (Nike+ compatible, obviously). I've had knee issues in the past, which motivated me to err towards the top end of the range, I swear. The presence of the striking red headed shop assistant with her beautiful blue eyes and athletic physique had absolutely nothing to do with my decision.</p>

<p>What was I talking about? Running! Right.</p>

<!-- More -->


<p><img class="center" src="/images/blog/2013/04/07/P1000436.JPG"><!-- header_img /images/blog/2013/04/07/P1000436.JPG --></p>

<p>Thusly equipped, I began striking out in the evenings and doing mixed running and walking intervals. Given my complete lack of a plan, I decided to work my way around the Meadows' sign posted mile long circuit, alternately running and walking the segments. After a couple of sessions of this, a few things become clear:</p>

<ul>
<li>I had absolutely no idea what sort of progress I was making. I was gathering no data;</li>
<li>I could only make fairly rough guesses at my actual pace;</li>
<li>I had no plan for how to increase the difficulty of my runs;</li>
<li>I wasn't having any fun. No data equals no graphs. No Graphs equals no fun. Obviously.</li>
</ul>


<p>As luck would have it, it was around that time when I stumbled across an ArsTecnica <a href="http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2009/11/reader-favorites-fitness-tech/">article which mentioned RunKeeper</a>, a combination of a website and (at the time) iPhone app which could be used to plan and track your runs. It would draw your route on a map, and draw all manner graphs of the data you generated. My. Oh. My.</p>

<p>Also mentioned in the review was the <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/c25k/Pages/couch-to-5k-plan.aspx">Couch to 5K program</a>, an NHS approved to program to take you from doing no running at all to being able to run 5K in one session over a period of several weeks, with a particular focus on preventing you getting either a) injured or b) bored. Seemed like a plan. I didn't want to be either of those things.</p>

<p>Like any good nerd I didn't go right out and sign up with RunKeeper, but spent a good long while reading reviews of other apps, some of which were C25K specific. RunKeeper won out in the end, though, and I started following the program during my lunch breaks (much more manageable than the evenings if you live in Scotland and don't want to run in the dark). Then the thing I'd been waiting over a year for happened. I got on a plane to Australia to support <a href="http://www.unmanned.co.uk/unmanned-vehicles-news/unmanned-autonomous-underwater-vehicles-uuv-auv-news/seebyte-breaks-record-with-gavia-auv/">Fugro's first foray into autonomous pipeline tracking</a>.</p>

<p>Now I was in Perth (the warm one) with a fair amount of spare time on my hands. Sometimes running around Edinburgh could be a serious chore. Even in summer it's not exactly warm a lot of the time and often times it's a bit on the rainy side. Perth was something else altogether, however. I'd chosen to stay in a small motel in the west of the city because:</p>

<ul>
<li>It was close to where I would be doing my work in the first phase of the job, so my commute would be short;</li>
<li>It was much cheaper than the more central hotels my company would normally have used, so I could spend more of the budget on food.</li>
</ul>


<p>Somehow, the thing which I hadn't factored into my planning was that the motel was also about a minute's walk from the coast road. That was a nice surprise, I can tell you. A long, helpfully flat, road with a minimum of interruptions which winds around a beautiful beach… and, oh yeah, looks sort of like this around sunset:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/blog/2013/04/07/P1000203.JPG"></p>

<p>Let me tell you: running under these circumstances is not a chore. Don't get me wrong: generally speaking it's something I like having done, rather than something I actually like doing. But these are pretty ideal circumstances. While waiting for the operations to actually get into gear (a common theme with any work in this field) a managed to get in a fair few runs.</p>

<p>I'll tell you what's not ideal for running, though: getting sent to Karratha, a baking hot oil and gas company town in the North of Western Australia, which unlike Perth has a lot of really small things which can kill you really, really quickly. Quickly <em>and</em> painfully.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/blog/2013/04/07/DSC01052.JPG"></p>

<p>Even less ideal is actually being sent offshore and spending a week or so floating on a small boat. Less ideal still is if that boat turns out to be a catamaran, and this is how you find out that catamarans make you very, very seasick. I'd worked offshore previously and even in bad weather, so I swear I'm not usually that much of a delicate flower when it comes to a bit of pitch and roll… but the evidence doesn't lie. I've never spent more time hugging either a railing or a toilet bowl than I did on that trip. Try working a laptop under <em>those</em> circumstances. But I digress...</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/blog/2013/04/07/DSC00889.JPG"></p>

<p>The final nail in the coffin of this crack at C25K was actually arriving back in Edinburgh and finding that in summer the weather was far less clement that Perth's winter climate. Going outside and running just plain wasn't something I had the will for.</p>

<p>I don't want to be too unfair to Edinburgh, though. I mean, Perth doesn't have any of this:</p>

    <updated>2013-04-01T20:07:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.harveynick.com/blog/2013/04/01/a-fitness-story</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>During most of university I was in pretty crap shape, but in the second year of my PhD my physical condition got particularly lousy. I caught a bus every morning which left from directly outside my flat and took me directly to the university. I did pretty much no exercise and ate an awful lot of takeaway. A few of my friends remarked that I'd gained weight. "Don't worry," they said "it's fine," in response to my mortified expression, I'm sure "You look well with it". But I knew I looked nothing of the sort.  To paraphrase Eddie Izzard: when I looked in the mirror I sure as hell didn't want to have sex with myself.</p>

<!-- More -->


<p>Then, as part of the job which ran in tandem with my studies I spend a couple of weeks working offshore on a maintenance ship. Where there was pretty much nothing to do. A worked, I ate, I slept. I played my way through Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas. But I also started to make use of the small gym on board the ship. Every day at around the same time I would go down, use the rowing machine for a while, use the cross trainer for a bit, maybe fiddle with the pec deck or the lat pulldown machine. Basically: I had no idea what I was doing… but I knew I had to do something.</p>

<p>Back on dry land I signed up for a gym and was given a workout program as part of a complementary training session. I told the trainer I wanted to use the machines and not the free weights, basically because I thought the guys who used the free weights were a bit douchey (based on the evidence I'd seen on the ship and the one time I'd visited the university gym). So for a year or two I diligently hit the gym three evenings a week and gradually increased the amount of weight I was moving around. Equally gradually I also started to like what I was seeing in the mirror.</p>

<p>It didn't last, though. My circumstances changed and I found myself working full time in a different part of the city, while also needing to finish writing my thesis. Getting to the gym in the evenings was now a lot harder… and so started to not happen. I fell back into bad habits and put back on a lot of the weight I'd lost.</p>

<p>I kept trying to get back on the wagon. Twice I started <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/c25k/Pages/couch-to-5k-plan.aspx">Couch to 5k</a>, and twice I failed to make it all the way through. The first, ironically, because I was sent to work offshore again in my previous job, and then my second attempt was scuppered by a foot injury. Every once in a while I would manage to drag myself to the work gym down here in London… but I didn't have any sort of a plan and I didn't really make any sort of progress.</p>

<p>Then it happened. This is the part of the story I'm very hesitant about discussing further. It's deeply personal. But it's also key.</p>

<p>I found myself in a rather fantastic situation with a very attractive member of the opposite sex. One I'd wanted to be in for some time. It was, as I'm sure you can imagine, a very positive experience. But it was also mortifying, because I found myself looking at this gorgeous lady and realizing how hard I was trying <em>not</em> to look at myself. The contrast between us was, to me, quite shocking. It was then that I thought to myself (and yes, I'm aware of the cliche) "I have to get myself in shape" and this time I really, really meant it.</p>

<p>What happened next? Well… fitness wise I got really geeky about it. Really geeky indeed. I'll talk about it more in a different post, but I will say this: I'm definitely making progress, much more successfully than I every did before. Project "look good naked" is in effect, and I'm bringing the technologies.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>2011 was an interesting year for me. A lot changed. I turned 30. After 10 years of residency I moved away from Edinburgh, a city I love dearly, and took a job in London. With <a href="/blog/tags/google">Google</a>. As a result, I no longer work with <a href="/blog/tags/autonomous-underwater-vehicles">Autonomous Underwater Vehicles</a> for a living. Instead I build web services. Quite the change, I'm sure you'll agree. In the early months of the year I finally completed the corrections to my <a href="/blog/tags/phd">PhD</a>, and then in the summer: I graduated. It took 6 years (all together) but I am now Dr. Nick Johnson. I also <a href="/blog/2011/07/18/the-sound-of-one-hand-clapping/">lost my grandmother</a>, a fact which still brings me to tears on occasion.</p>

<p>In this light, the fact that I decided, towards the end of the year, to shift my blog away from <a href="http://wordpress.org">Wordpress</a> and over to its own domain barely even casts a shadow. I did, though, and as a result you're now reading these words on a site built using <a href="http://octopress.org">Octopress</a>, which is hosted at harveynick.com. As you may have noticed, all of the old posts from my <a href="http://harveynick.wordpress.com">wordpress site</a> have been ported over, minus the short film reviews, which you'll find <a href="http://ohsohumbleopinion.tumblr.com">here</a>. I'm not going to go into how I accomplished this, except to say: I did it the same way <a href="http://mattgemmell.com/2011/09/12/blogging-with-octopress/">Matt Gemmel did</a>.</p>

For the most part, this site is stock Octopress. I've played with the fonts, made the heading and background static and added a little more infrastructure (index pages for tags, embed scripts for YouTube and Vimeo videos and a couple of other bits). It's not finished, but it will serve well enough for me to try and start producing actual content again. I do want to make it a bit more visual, particularly the front page, and somehow integrate other content I produce into it. I also want to make it work a little better on mobile browsers and, lastly, make it a little bit more my own. The colours will change, and I'll try to find a background which doesn't require such a large file and isn't so closely associated with Apple.

<p>What will I be writing about though? Well:</p>

<p>I plan to have <a href="/blog/tags/clockwork-aphid">Clockwork Aphid</a> actually doing something of use this year. I'm going to enhance the current Java version up to a point where it can generate interesting landscapes efficiently and in a parallel fashion. I'm then going to then have a crack at porting it to <a href="http://golang.org">Go</a>, which I think may turn out to be an excellent language for writing computer games.</p>

<p>I like films. Perchance you may have noticed. I may chat a bit more in depth about a couple of this year's releases. Just to pick three with a common theme off the top of my head:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>The Amazing Spider-Man</strong>. I went to a preview event for this in Leicester Square a month or two ago and was very impressed with what I saw. I'm hopeful they made a Spider-Man movie in the same way that Christopher Nolan makes Batman movies. Really really.</li>
<li><strong>The Dark Knight Rises</strong>. Speaking of which. This <em>is</em> exciting. It's the last of the trilogy. It's got a lot to live up to, especially since the last film Nolan made was <em>Inception</em>. I wouldn't bet against it, though.</li>
<li><strong>The Avengers</strong>. Now here's a film with some scope. All these characters in one film? With this cast? Written and directed by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joss_Whedon">Joss Mother Fucking* Whedon</a>? Please, please let this film live up to the frankly stupid amount of potential it has.</li>
</ul>


<p>Quite recently, at the aforementioned age of 30, I started playing Dungeons and Dragons with a selection of my colleagues. Well, we're actually playing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathfinder_Roleplaying_Game">Pathfinder</a>, but let us not quibble about semantics. I'm having a really great time on several different levels. It's an interesting experience for someone who has played computer games for most of their life, but never dabbled in table top RPGs.</p>

<p>I mentioned before that I now have a shiny new PhD, with the letters before and after my name to prove it. I'm of the opinion that the work which led to this is quite interesting (but then I would be). It's also not completely divorced from my Clockwork Aphid project. I'm of a mind to try talking about this some, also.</p>

<p>See you when we get there.</p>

<p>* I think these are his actual middle names.</p>
