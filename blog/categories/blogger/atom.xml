    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It's good to have goals. Even if you fail to meet them. Sometimes especially when you fail to meet them. It's quite widely publicized that at Google we're expected to score 0.7 (on a scale where 0 is a complete failure and 1 means all targets were met) when assessing our OKRs (objectives and key results). Generally this is good. It means you're always striving, always raising your eyes, hitting the top of the tree by aiming for the sky.</p>

<p>In my personal life, though, this probably isn't the best approach. Be that as it may, this year I have goals.</p>

<!-- More -->


<p>1. Get myself in shape.</p>

<p>Also known as: project "look good naked". There's a bit more to it than this, of course. There's also a bit of a story behind it, which I'll probably tell in a later post. I also have some ideas around this area which might turn into something else. If I'm going to set goals, I need a way to measure success, after all.</p>

<p>Talking about this here leaves me with a slightly odd problem, though. When I relaunched this blog I adjusted all of my category names to be descriptive nouns, which means a can auto-generate the part of the about text (on the right) which references them. I don't know what the appropriate noun is for someone who participates in and thinks about fitness related activities. This is a stupid problem to have, but it is a problem, nevertheless.</p>

<p>2. Get my House in order.</p>

<p>In the literal sense. One of the reasons things went dark on this blog last year is that I actually took the plunge and bought a flat. This ate a lot of my time and left my life in a bit of an inconsistent state for a month or so. Now I'm in, though, and having spent a winter in the place I've taken stock. It needs some work. It needs to be warmer when the weather is cold. It needs a bit more personality… and some of the really odd design decisions made by the previous owners need to be reversed.</p>

<p>It's also a whole new playground for me to seek adventures in. My Clockwork Aphid project was a casualty of the upheaval in my life last year and I'm not sure how much attention it'll get this year… because this year I'd also like to start playing with home automation. Nothing crazy. No robot butlers; but we'll see.</p>

<p>3. Read. Travel. Watch. Write.</p>

<p>This one is more straight forward. I'd like to start more closely measuring how much a read, travel, watch (mainly in terms of films) and write, on this blog an elsewhere.</p>

<p>Reading is straightforward, I think. I read a lot. On my way to work, before bed, in coffee shops at the weekend, But I'm curious to try and keep tabs on what I'm reading and how much. It frustrates the hell out of me that my kindle can't easily supply me with the information.</p>

<p>One of my friends has a goal for this year that she will get out of Edinburgh at least once every month. That's not a bad goal to have at all. For me, I'd just like to see and experience more of the wider world in general, but also the part of it which I inhabit.</p>

<p>As for watching films and keeping tabs on what I saw… well… I already have <a href="http://ohsohumbleopinion.tumblr.com">a place to keep tabs on that</a>. Simple. This is mostly a matter of "keep it up".</p>

<p>Lastly: writing. Er… yes. I don't have such a great record with this one. Obviously I want to get back to posting regularly on this blog… but I'd also like to try and do something with the two screenplays I wrote during university (and the pile of partially developed ones). I used to regularly do some sort of creative writing and lately I'm starting to feel the lack of it in my life.</p>

    <link href="http://www.harveynick.com/blog/2013/03/22/ch-ch-ch-changes/"/>
    <updated>2013-03-22T00:30:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.harveynick.com/blog/2013/03/22/ch-ch-ch-changes</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So a couple of things about this website have changed. Perhaps you've noticed.</p>

<p>Firstly, I changed the background. Much as I love that dark linen image I was using, it's really obviously "the apple background", which carries connotations I didn't really want to project. The first place I saw it was on an apple device, granted, but I wasn't using it <em>because</em> it's the apple background. The new one is similar aesthetically, yet distinct enough that I don't think it screams "fanboi". It'll do for now. More on that later.</p>

<p>I've also removed that cool effect where the background and title remained static, and the actual content appear to slide up an over them. Again, I loved it, but it made the scrolling really janky on a lot of devices. I'm choosing to assume it was the combination of the drop shadow and static background which was causing this... and since the slide effect doesn't work anywhere near as well without the drop shadow, but the drop shadow seems just fine without the slide I've decided to move over to plain old normal scrolling. Unless you're on a really small screen, in which case the drop shadow should disappear as well (try resizing your browser window, you'll see what I mean).</p>

<!-- More -->


<p>Lastly, there's a small ad at the bottom of the sidebar.</p>

<p><blockquote><p>Say what? Oh no your didn't! Why? WHY!?</p></blockquote></p>

<p>As you may or may not be aware, I work on the <a href="http://www.google.com/adsense">AdSense</a> team at Google, and our management has encouraged us to actually become AdSense publishers. I've been resisting this change for quite some time, but decided it was probably time to bite the bullet and start eating my team's dog food. It bothers me a bit, I have to admit. I'm going to play with moving it around and changing the settings on the AdSense Front End and see if I can achieve a situation where:</p>

<ul>
<li>It doesn't bother me so much;</li>
<li>It's actually effective.</li>
</ul>


<p>I hope it doesn't bother you too much. Don't worry, this isn't me trying to monetize you. There will probably more some more changes coming, but let's not get ahead of ourselves.</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[Wandering Around London]]></title>
    <link href="http://www.harveynick.com/blog/2012/05/17/wandering-around-london/"/>
    <updated>2012-05-17T21:57:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.harveynick.com/blog/2012/05/17/wandering-around-london</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Apologies, once again, for the radio silence. Over the past couple of months there have been some complications in my private life, and a remarkable amount of my attention has been taken up with figuring out where exactly I'm going to be living after my current lease runs out (more on that later, perhaps).</p>

<p>Be that as it may, after almost a year, I did find some time to go wandering around the city I now call home. Whilst I took every opportunity to make a brisk constitutional around Edinburgh, I'd never managed to really do this in London. Part of the reason, I think, is while that you can essentially wander across central Edinburgh in an hour or two, this is really not the case in London. Nipping across town via public transport can take <em>hours</em>.</p>

<p>Recently, though, two excellent excuses presented themselves. Firstly, my father came to visit for a few days and professed an interest to go take a good look at <a href="http://www.kew.org/">Kew Gardens</a>, the Japanese themed portion in particular.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>First stop was the <a href="http://www.kew.org/visit-kew-gardens/garden-attractions-A-Z/Pagoda.htm">Pagoda</a>:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/blog/2012/05/13/IMG_0402.jpg"></p>

<p>This is a fairly impressive and imposing building, at least from a distance. Close up it's curiously less so. I think it's the red brick construction which does it. I've never visited Japan, but this seems a slightly inappropriate building material to me. My father, who has, concurred.</p>

<p>Next was the <a href="http://www.kew.org/visit-kew-gardens/garden-attractions-A-Z/japanese-gateway.htm">Japanese Gateway</a> which, in conjunction with the weather, gave me an excellent opportunity to try out the HDR mode on my phone's camera. Here it is without the benefit of HDR:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/blog/2012/05/17/IMG_0408.jpg"></p>

<p>…and here it is with the HDR turned on:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/blog/2012/05/13/IMG_0409.jpg"></p>

<p>I'll be listing that featuring under "worthwhile" from here on out. At this point it's probably worth confirming a slightly frustrating fact which I suspect is now true of many people: the camera on my phone has completely killed any use of my point and shoot camera. It's extremely convenient (being as I <em>always</em> have it with me) and, since my last upgrade, actually very capable. The only thing it lacks is zoom, which is a trade off I'm willing to make. If I plan on going on a serious photo taking excursion at any point in the future I may bite the bullet and pick up a decent digital SLR. The point and shoot just feels like a weird middle gear at this point.</p>

<p>Back to Kew Gardens, though. Tucked off to one side and not especially well advertised is the Bonsai house. It's small, but quite cool, and something my dad specifically wanted to see (Bonsai being a hobby of his).</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/blog/2012/05/13/IMG_0448.jpg"></p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/blog/2012/05/13/IMG_0450.jpg"></p>

<p>Next, we moved away from the specifically Asian attractions and took a look in the <a href="http://www.kew.org/visit-kew-gardens/garden-attractions-A-Z/Palm-House.htm">Palm House</a>. This really is an impressive building, if uncomfortably hot and humid. Be ready to sweat, all ye who enter here. Besides the tropical plants (which I don't seem to have taken any pictures of), the green house itself has an impressive art deco* construction:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/blog/2012/05/13/IMG_0451.jpg"></p>

<p>Shortly after this, we took the train from Richmond back to my flat, and I had the fun of explaining to my father the difference between underground and overground trains this far out of the centre ("you can tell that's an underground train because it says 'underground' on it…").</p>

<p>A week or two later, I professed a desire to go see <a href="http://ohsohumbleopinion.tumblr.com/post/19950925968/john-carter">John Carter</a> to friend who suggested we see it in Canary Wharf, allowing us to go wandering around the area beforehand. So we did.</p>

<p>Canary Wharf is one of the parts of London containing buildings which can legitimately be called skyscrapers (I think). I believe it's also London's financial district. Surprisingly, I actually find it a very pleasant place to be. The taller buildings make you feel as though you're walking through canyons, and the area is very clean, though not to the point of feeling antiseptic.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/blog/2012/05/13/IMG_0463.jpg"></p>

<p>At the weekend it's extremely quiet without quite feeling like a ghost town and there are a surprising amount of things to find. These include a large underground mall, some very cool riverside buildings:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/blog/2012/05/17/IMG_0460.jpg"></p>

<p>…and one or two very cool statue / landmark type things:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/blog/2012/05/13/IMG_0456.jpg"><!-- header_img /images/blog/2012/05/13/IMG_0456.jpg --></p>

<p>Interestingly, the whole area is also private property, so you might have submit to a vehicle search on the way in. Be that as may, I can recommend it as a reasonable place to wander around at the weekend.</p>

<p>Until next time...</p>

<p>* This is art deco, right?</p>

    <link href="http://www.harveynick.com/blog/2012/04/14/now-were-blogging-with-photos/"/>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Fair warning: this is going to be a bit of a programming heavy blog post. It's also going to be quite Mac specific.</em></p>

<p>One of the things I wanted to change about the format of this blog was to make it more visual, specifically with pictures. This first part of this was to add pictures to the front page. There were a couple of options for doing so. I could just scan through an article, look for the first image tag and use this. Alternatively I could add a mechanism which allowed me to choose the image, in a similar manner to the way <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a> allows me to choose the except which appears on the front page. I decided to go with option two.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>The first part of this was to modify the image tag plug-in like so:</p>

<p>This adds an <code>html</code> comment containing the image path to the page when I use <code>header_img</code> as a <a href="https://github.com/Shopify/liquid/wiki">Liquid</a> tag name rather than the original <code>img</code>. Next I need to do something with this comment. I created an additional Liquid filter which pulls the path out and replaces it with an actual image embed:</p>

<p>Next I modified my theme to run this filter over the page contents just before the one which creates the except on the front page. I'll leave this as an exercise for the reader. Lastly, I needed to account for the fact that the created image could be just about any size, while I want some uniformity on the front page. Those of you playing at home will have noticed I assigned <code>header</code> as the class of the image. This allows me to control the appearance of the front page images by adding the following to the <code>sass</code> files in my theme (which are used to generate the <code>css</code>):</p>

<p>Presto. Front page images.</p>

<p>Next, I wanted to try and make it easier to include pictures which I myself have taken with an actual camera (or, more likely, my phone). There really isn't any problem when you're linking to images elsewhere on the internet, but things can get a bit stickier when you want to include your own images on an Octopress blog. One option is to use a hosted service, like Flickr or PhotoBucket, but this only works when you have an internet connection. I really love that Octopress allows me to work on my site while offline, and I didn't want to lose this advantage when I'm posting pictures. Thus, I decided to just stick the images in my blog's images folder.</p>

<p>iPhoto is pretty great for organising and sharing photos (with supported services), but definitely doesn't make your life easy if you want to actually get at the image files themselves. That's the first problem. The second is that I also want to resize them to something reasonable for my blog. Lastly I want this to be low hassle. I came to the conclusion that an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AppleScript">Applescript</a> is what was required, and this is what I came up with:</p>

<p>Now, Applescript the programming language is completely mental and can be a complete pain in the arse to get right, but Applescript the mechanism is spectacularly powerful. You can do some serious automation with it. This script grabs the path to the currently selected photograph in iPhoto, resizes it and copies it to a folder inside my blog, generated using today's date to avoid duplication. Lastly, it places the location of the image on the clipboard, in the form it's needed.</p>

<p>To use it, I enabled the scripts menu (it's an option in the Applescript editor) and copied the script to the iPhoto scripts folder, which will be something like <code>/Users/&lt;user&gt;/Library/Scripts/Applications/iPhoto</code>. This might be hidden by default, but you can find it via the scripts menu while in iPhoto.</p>

<p>Then, all that is required is to select a photo, trigger the script, and then hit cmd-c in the post I'm writing. Bingo!</p>

<p>After getting this working, I remembered an <a href="http://arstechnica.com/apple/guides/2011/09/tutorial-os-x-automation-with-macruby-and-the-scripting-bridge.ars/2">ArsTecnica article</a> about using <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a> in place of Applescript for this purpose, so I converted the script to Ruby as an exercise. This is what I came up with:</p>

<p>Ruby is a much more sensible language, and this, to me, is a lot easier to follow. I'm fairly new to Ruby, so this might not actually be the most Ruby-ish way of doing it, mind. It should be noted that it will only work with <a href="http://www.macruby.org/">MacRuby</a>, though. You will also need <a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php">ImageMagick</a> installed. I made this executable with a quick <code>chmod +x</code> and moved it to the iPhoto scripts folder as well, where it seems to work just fine. So now I have two options. Hopefully, someone out there finds this useful.</p>

<p>Finally, to prove it works, and because it feels a little strange to not actually have any pictures in this entry: here's a nice shot taken at Kew Gardens (which hopefully I'll talk about more later):</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>2011 was an interesting year for me. A lot changed. I turned 30. After 10 years of residency I moved away from Edinburgh, a city I love dearly, and took a job in London. With <a href="/blog/tags/google">Google</a>. As a result, I no longer work with <a href="/blog/tags/autonomous-underwater-vehicles">Autonomous Underwater Vehicles</a> for a living. Instead I build web services. Quite the change, I'm sure you'll agree. In the early months of the year I finally completed the corrections to my <a href="/blog/tags/phd">PhD</a>, and then in the summer: I graduated. It took 6 years (all together) but I am now Dr. Nick Johnson. I also <a href="/blog/2011/07/18/the-sound-of-one-hand-clapping/">lost my grandmother</a>, a fact which still brings me to tears on occasion.</p>

<p>In this light, the fact that I decided, towards the end of the year, to shift my blog away from <a href="http://wordpress.org">Wordpress</a> and over to its own domain barely even casts a shadow. I did, though, and as a result you're now reading these words on a site built using <a href="http://octopress.org">Octopress</a>, which is hosted at harveynick.com. As you may have noticed, all of the old posts from my <a href="http://harveynick.wordpress.com">wordpress site</a> have been ported over, minus the short film reviews, which you'll find <a href="http://ohsohumbleopinion.tumblr.com">here</a>. I'm not going to go into how I accomplished this, except to say: I did it the same way <a href="http://mattgemmell.com/2011/09/12/blogging-with-octopress/">Matt Gemmel did</a>.</p>

For the most part, this site is stock Octopress. I've played with the fonts, made the heading and background static and added a little more infrastructure (index pages for tags, embed scripts for YouTube and Vimeo videos and a couple of other bits). It's not finished, but it will serve well enough for me to try and start producing actual content again. I do want to make it a bit more visual, particularly the front page, and somehow integrate other content I produce into it. I also want to make it work a little better on mobile browsers and, lastly, make it a little bit more my own. The colours will change, and I'll try to find a background which doesn't require such a large file and isn't so closely associated with Apple.
</span></p>

<p>What will I be writing about though? Well:</p>

<p>I plan to have <a href="/blog/tags/clockwork-aphid">Clockwork Aphid</a> actually doing something of use this year. I'm going to enhance the current Java version up to a point where it can generate interesting landscapes efficiently and in a parallel fashion. I'm then going to then have a crack at porting it to <a href="http://golang.org">Go</a>, which I think may turn out to be an excellent language for writing computer games.</p>

<p>I like films. Perchance you may have noticed. I may chat a bit more in depth about a couple of this year's releases. Just to pick three with a common theme off the top of my head:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>The Amazing Spider-Man</strong>. I went to a preview event for this in Leicester Square a month or two ago and was very impressed with what I saw. I'm hopeful they made a Spider-Man movie in the same way that Christopher Nolan makes Batman movies. Really really.</li>
<li><strong>The Dark Knight Rises</strong>. Speaking of which. This <em>is</em> exciting. It's the last of the trilogy. It's got a lot to live up to, especially since the last film Nolan made was <em>Inception</em>. I wouldn't bet against it, though.</li>
<li><strong>The Avengers</strong>. Now here's a film with some scope. All these characters in one film? With this cast? Written and directed by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joss_Whedon">Joss Mother Fucking* Whedon</a>? Please, please let this film live up to the frankly stupid amount of potential it has.</li>
</ul>


<p>Quite recently, at the aforementioned age of 30, I started playing Dungeons and Dragons with a selection of my colleagues. Well, we're actually playing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathfinder_Roleplaying_Game">Pathfinder</a>, but let us not quibble about semantics. I'm having a really great time on several different levels. It's an interesting experience for someone who has played computer games for most of their life, but never dabbled in table top RPGs.</p>

<p>I mentioned before that I now have a shiny new PhD, with the letters before and after my name to prove it. I'm of the opinion that the work which led to this is quite interesting (but then I would be). It's also not completely divorced from my Clockwork Aphid project. I'm of a mind to try talking about this some, also.</p>

<p>See you when we get there.</p>

<p>* I think these are his actual middle names.</p>
