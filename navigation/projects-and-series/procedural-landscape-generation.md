Some years ago, the combination of three things came together:

* The incredible world building of Robin Hobb's [Farseer Trilogy](https://amzn.to/2UPgQCs);
* A [series of posts](https://www.introversion.co.uk/subversion/) by Introversion software about procedural generation;
* Being stuck in a hotel room in [Karatha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karratha,_Western_Australia) with nothing to do but read and think.

I had an idea about building procedurally generated worlds, and haphazardly started trying to build it. It didn't really go anywhere, but someday I'd love to revisit some of the ideas.
