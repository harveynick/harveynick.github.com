The second language I'm considering is **C++**. This is the language that I use the most at my day job. It's also the language that's used to build the vast majority of computer games and one hell of a lot of commercial software. I'm not as familiar with it as I am with Java, but I know it well enough to be productive with it. I'm also familiar enough with it to know how horribly [broken](http://yosefk.com/c++fqa/) it is in many respects. One of the major design goals of Java (among other more modern programming languages) was to fix the problems with C++. It also has no dynamic capabilities what-so-ever, but it's possible to paper over this by using a minimal dynamic runtime such as [Lua](http://www.lua.org/) for scripting.

All things being equal, C++ is the fastest of the three languages. It is also the one you're most likely to write bad code in, though, so there's a bit of a trade off here.  

As I mentioned, most games are programmed using C++. As a result, there is a veritable shit load of graphics engine options. I would probably tend towards using the open source[Ogre3D](http://www.ogre3d.org/) rendering engine (or something similar), but it's worth baring in mind that I could easily switch to using, say, the Quake 3 engine (open sourced by id) if I wanted to. I could also port the project to using a commercial graphics engine if I had the desire to do such a thing.  
The measure of applicability to other parties is definitely a point in favour of C++. Code written in C++ would be the easiest of the three for deployment as part of a larger project, as that project is most likely to be written in C++. In terms of acting as a developer showcase C++ has the edge as well, as it's the language a lot of companies ask for code samples in.
