I'm Nick Johnson, a software engineer, cinefile, foodie, bibliophile, gym rat, machine which turns coffee into code, and general purpose nerd. Technically, my name is Dr. Nick Johnson PhD.

Currently I'm a "Quant Developer" at a small London hedgefund called [Quadrature Capital]. Previously I was a senior software engineer at Google. Amongst other things, I helped ship Google Calendar for iPhone and AdSense for iPhone. Before that I worked on autonomous underwater robotics at Heriot-Watt University's [Ocean Systems Lab], and that lab's spin out company, [SeeByte Ltd].

This is a blog about hacking, food, movies, books, music, and whatever else happens to pop into my head. I hope you enjoy it.
