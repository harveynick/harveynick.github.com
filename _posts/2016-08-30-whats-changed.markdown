Well, I went quiet again, didn't I? While I've been away it feels like the world changed quite a bit. For starters, from an entirely personal perspective, I moved flats and areas of London. A transaction which completed on the 24th of June, 2016. If this date sounds familiar, that's because it's also the date the results of the UK's "Brexit" referendum were released. Like I said: the world feels like it's changed quite a bit.

For the record, this is probably the worst possible day I could have completed such a transaction since the financial crash back in 2008. There are an epic amount of uncertainty surrounding the UK right now. Both major British political parties fell completely to pieces in the wake of Brexit, and neither seems to have quite put itself back together again.

In fact politics on both sides of the atlantic seem to have gone completely insane. Over in the US, Donald Trump seems to have stopped pretending that his candidacy is anything more than a money-making and brand-building endeavour for him. I've lost count of the number of batshit insane things he's said since I last wrote here.

I've also travelled some since I last wrote here. California for work, followed by a side trip to Texas, then a short trip up to Edinburgh. So that's a positive, at least from my point of view.

My point? I'm not sure I actually have one. This is really more of a verbal shake of the head, followed by a shrug.
