A while ago I started working on a procedural landscape generation project and then... I stopped. I didn't stop because I was no longer interested in the subject (I assure you I very much am), but because a) my free time got a lot more limited; and b) I'd bitten off more than I could chew and didn't know where to go next.

Some of the ideas original ideas from that project have become an entirely new (and very non-obviously linked) side project. Which has actual clear goals. I plan on writing about it soon.

There are a couple of reasons for this post. One is just to give me a easy reference the back to the old posts on this subject. The other is that I recently happened upon some of my old notes about this project. Here's an example:

This is why paper notebooks are always better than digital ones, for me. I never would have come across this if it was locked up inside Evernote. At the time I thought this was going to be a straightforward visual representation of what I had in mind...

The remainder of this post is a list of the posts I actually wrote about this project, in chronological order. The ones with a bullet are the ones which really get into the nitty gritty of it.
