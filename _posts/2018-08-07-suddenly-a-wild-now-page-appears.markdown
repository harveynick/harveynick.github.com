There’s a [new page](https://harveynick.com/now/) in the menu of this site. First of all I’ll make an admission: the idea is shamelessly stolen from [Jacoby Young](http://www.jacobyyoung.com/now). Hopefully it’s meaning is fairly self explanatory. It’s mostly there for my own self reflection, which I’ve decided to do in public, apparently.

My working plan is that I’ll update this page about once a month. I suspect that the favourite podcasts list to stay mostly unchanged over time, but I can see almost everything else changing on a monthly basis.

Something else: right now it says I’m reading three books. That’s mostly because I found Joon Ha Lee’s [Ninefox Gambit](http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/1781084483/?tag=harveyncom-21) hard enough going that I needed to take a break after the first few chapters. That book is *work*.
