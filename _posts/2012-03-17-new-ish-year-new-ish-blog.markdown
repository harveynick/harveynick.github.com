2011 was an interesting year for me. A lot changed. I turned 30. After 10 years of residency I moved away from Edinburgh, a city I love dearly, and took a job in London. With [Google]. As a result, I no longer work with [Autonomous Underwater Vehicles] for a living. Instead I build web services. Quite the change, I'm sure you'll agree. In the early months of the year I finally completed the corrections to my [PhD], and then in the summer: I graduated. It took 6 years (all together) but I am now Dr. Nick Johnson. I also [lost my grandmother], a fact which still brings me to tears on occasion.

In this light, the fact that I decided, towards the end of the year, to shift my blog away from [Wordpress] and over to its own domain barely even casts a shadow. I did, though, and as a result you're now reading these words on a site built using [Octopress], which is hosted at harveynick.com. As you may have noticed, all of the old posts from my [wordpress site] have been ported over, minus the short film reviews, which you'll find [here]. I'm not going to go into how I accomplished this, except to say: I did it the same way [Matt Gemmel did].

For the most part, this site is stock Octopress. I've played with the fonts, made the heading and background static and added a little more infrastructure (index pages for tags, embed scripts for YouTube and Vimeo videos and a couple of other bits). It's not finished, but it will serve well enough for me to try and start producing actual content again. I do want to make it a bit more visual, particularly the front page, and somehow integrate other content I produce into it. I also want to make it work a little better on mobile browsers and, lastly, make it a little bit more my own. The colours will change, and I'll try to find a background which doesn't require such a large file and isn't so closely associated with Apple.


What will I be writing about though? Well: 

I plan to have [Clockwork Aphid] actually doing something of use this year. I'm going to enhance the current Java version up to a point where it can generate interesting landscapes efficiently and in a parallel fashion. I'm then going to then have a crack at porting it to [Go], which I think may turn out to be an excellent language for writing computer games.

I like films. Perchance you may have noticed. I may chat a bit more in depth about a couple of this year's releases. Just to pick three with a common theme off the top of my head:

* **The Amazing Spider-Man**. I went to a preview event for this in Leicester Square a month or two ago and was very impressed with what I saw. I'm hopeful they made a Spider-Man movie in the same way that Christopher Nolan makes Batman movies. Really really.
* **The Dark Knight Rises**. Speaking of which. This *is* exciting. It's the last of the trilogy. It's got a lot to live up to, especially since the last film Nolan made was *Inception*. I wouldn't bet against it, though.
* **The Avengers**. Now here's a film with some scope. All these characters in one film? With this cast? Written and directed by Joss Mother Fucking[^1] [Whedon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joss_Whedon)? Please, please let this film live up to the frankly stupid amount of potential it has.

Quite recently, at the aforementioned age of 30, I started playing Dungeons and Dragons with a selection of my colleagues. Well, we're actually playing [Pathfinder], but let us not quibble about semantics. I'm having a really great time on several different levels. It's an interesting experience for someone who has played computer games for most of their life, but never dabbled in table top RPGs.

I mentioned before that I now have a shiny new PhD, with the letters before and after my name to prove it. I'm of the opinion that the work which led to this is quite interesting (but then I would be). It's also not completely divorced from my Clockwork Aphid project. I'm of a mind to try talking about this some, also.

See you when we get there.
