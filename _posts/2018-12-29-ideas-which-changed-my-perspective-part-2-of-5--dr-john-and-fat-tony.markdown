Let’s get this out of the way first: [Nassim Nicholas Taleb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nassim_Nicholas_Taleb) is a… difficult character. He can be pretty… reactionary in public forums. Especially Twitter. You might not want to get to know him better. But that doesn’t change the fact that [Fooled by Randomness](https://amzn.to/2z30s9d) and [The Black Swan](https://amzn.to/2z2Sw7M) are both fascinating and thought provoking books[^1]. Be warned: they are both written in a very flippant and meandering style, which I can only describe as “stream of consciousness”. I found both to be difficult, but definitely worth the effort.

The standout idea for me (and so it seems for most others I’ve spoken to about these books) is a spin on a logical fallacy which tends to come up in during probability lessons. The human mind wants to think that if a coin is flipped ten times and comes up heads, they it must be more likely to come up tails next time. It’s sometimes called [the gamblers fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambler%27s_fallacy). The truth is that the chance is always 50/50, regardless of the previous flips. Or is it? Enter Nassim Taleb:

> NNT (that is, me): Assume that a coin is fair, i.e., has an equal probability of coming up heads or tails when flipped. I flip it ninety-nine times and get heads each time. What are the odds of my getting tails on my next throw?
> Dr. John: Trivial question. One half, of course, since you are assuming 50 percent odds for each and independence between draws.
> NNT: What do you say, Tony?
> Fat Tony: I’d say no more than 1 percent, of course.
> NNT: Why so? I gave you the initial assumption of a fair coin, meaning that it was 50 percent either way.
> Fat Tony: You are either full of crap or a pure sucker to buy that “50 pehcent” business. The coin gotta be loaded. It can’t be a fair game. (Translation: It is far more likely that your assumptions about the fairness are wrong than the coin delivering ninety-nine heads in ninety-nine throws.)

This is essentially a version of [Occam’s Razor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor) which encourages you to question *every* complication, even the rules themselves. Why do you believe a tossed coin is fair in the first place? Have you checked?

The upshot of this is that I now try to inspect (and test) the rules of any game, real or metaphorical, I find myself taking part in. Every time I take part.
