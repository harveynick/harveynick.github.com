I'm Nick Johnson, a senior software engineer at Google, cinefile, foodie, bibliophile, gym rat, machine which turns coffee into code and general purpose nerd. Technically, my name is Dr. Nick Johnson PhD.

These days I write iPhone Apps and API backends at Google. Previously I worked on autonomous underwater robotics at Heriot-Watt University's [Ocean Systems Lab], and that lab's spin out company, [SeeByte Ltd].

This is a blog about hacking, food, movies, books, music, and whatever else happens to pop into my head. The idea of it is to be a home for (relatively) long form writing, the sort of posts which might get written over a couple of days.

Here are the other places you might find me on the web:


## [Tango Lima; Delta Romeo]

My semi-regularly updated (in other words: it gets updated in batches via the Tumblr queue) short film review blog. Forcing myself to use 25 words or fewer pretty much the only way I can write film reviews. Otherwise they end up being 10,000 words. Given that I write short posts and tend to write them in batches Tumblr is pretty much the ideal place for this.


## [My LinkedIn Profile]

If you want a web based CV / resume in a place recruiters might see it: this is the place to put it. It's basically the reason I ended up with an interview, and then a job, at Google. This being the case, I tend to find articles which describe it as a pointless waste of time (I'm looking at you, [Hacker News]) slightly hilarious.


## [My Twitter Feed]

I'm not going to lie to you, I don't use Twitter very much. I just don't feel the urge to update it. But still, it's there.
